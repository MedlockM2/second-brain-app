# Manual Test Checklist - Share-First Flow UX

This checklist validates the mobile UX for the share-first flow across the app.
Test on at least one small viewport (320px width, e.g. iPhone SE) and one standard viewport (390-430px, e.g. iPhone 15 / Pixel 7).

## Test Devices

| Device | Screen Width | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Small viewport (iPhone SE / 320px equivalent) | 320px | [ ] Tested |
| Standard viewport (iPhone 15 / Pixel 7 / 390-430px) | 390-430px | [ ] Tested |

- [ ] Greeting text is visible and not truncated
- [ ] Daily Digest button is fully tappable with one thumb (min 56px height)
- [ ] Each media item card is large enough to tap comfortably (min 56px)
- [ ] Media type badges are readable at 11px
- [ ] Time labels ("2h ago") are visible

- [ ] Items with "completed" status have NO processing footer (clean card)
- [ ] Items with "failed" status show error styling (red container)
- [ ] Polling updates items in real-time (within 5 seconds)

### Pull-to-Refresh

- [ ] Refresh completes and updates list
- [ ] Error during refresh shows friendly message

### Empty State
- [ ] Empty inbox shows share hint with icon
- [ ] Text is centered and readable

---

## 2. Share Entry Flow (AC#3)

### Share from External App
- [ ] Sharing a URL from Safari/Chrome opens share confirmation screen
- [ ] Transition animation is smooth (slide from bottom)
- [ ] URL preview card shows the shared URL
- [ ] Domain is extracted and displayed correctly
- [ ] Close (X) button is tappable (44px)
- [ ] Save button is tappable (48px minimum height)

### Share Confirmation (ingestion starts on arrival — task-378)
- [ ] The card shows a spinner without any tap: the submission left on arrival
- [ ] The card footer turns into a checkmark ("Processing started") once accepted
- [ ] The screen does **not** auto-dismiss on a share, whatever the outcome
- [ ] The folder row is still usable while the card shows a spinner
- [ ] Tapping Save closes the screen and leaves exactly one item in the inbox
- [ ] Tapping X removes the item — gone from the inbox and from Search
- [ ] Tapping X while offline shows "Could not remove it" with a working retry
- [ ] A local import (file picker, camera) still submits on Save and auto-dismisses

### Sharing a note (task-380 — needs a fresh EAS build, not an OTA update)
- [ ] iOS: sharing a note from **Apple Notes** opens the confirmation screen with its text
- [ ] Android: sharing a note from **Google Keep** does the same
- [ ] Android (Samsung device): sharing a note from **Samsung Notes** does the same
- [ ] The preview label reads "Note" — the words "WhatsApp" and "message" appear nowhere
- [ ] The preview icon is a document, not a speech bubble
- [ ] The top bar reads "Save Note"
- [ ] Once processed, the title is the note's own first line (a Markdown `# Heading` loses its `#`)
- [ ] Exporting the same note to `.txt`, then `.md`, then `.rtf` and sharing each one: all three are accepted, and their content reads as text with accents and paragraphs intact
- [ ] A text file debits nothing: the minutes gauge on Account is unchanged after the three imports
- [ ] iOS: sharing a **locked** note shows "This note has no text to save…" and the screen stays open
- [ ] A note longer than 50,000 characters is refused with the two figures in the sentence
- [ ] A 0-byte `.txt` is refused before any transfer; a whitespace-only `.txt` fails with "This document could not be read…"
- [ ] A note holding text **and** a photo presents exactly one item — never a blank screen that closes itself
- [ ] Selecting several files at once and sharing them presents exactly one, and one the app can handle
- [ ] The paywall shows a "Notes" chip, a "TXT MD RTF" chip, and a "A note or a text file / Free" cost row
- [ ] Sharing a **voice note** from WhatsApp still says audio, not note

### Validation
- [ ] Invalid URL shows validation error banner (red)
- [ ] Empty share shows appropriate error message
- [ ] Error banner has visible retry link

### Typing a link in from the "+" menu (task-379)
- [ ] "+" on Home offers "Paste a link" above the file and photo rows
- [ ] The dialog opens *after* the sheet has finished closing (no dead modal on iOS)
- [ ] The field has focus on opening, and the keyboard is the URL one (`/`, `.com`)
- [ ] Nothing is auto-capitalised and nothing is auto-corrected while typing
- [ ] A long press in the field offers the system Paste, and pasting works
- [ ] The keyboard rises without covering the field or the two buttons
- [ ] Add is disabled while the field is empty
- [ ] `just some words` is refused under the field, the dialog stays open, the text
      is kept, and no item appears in the inbox after a pull-to-refresh
- [ ] A URL pasted with a sentence around it is accepted, and only the URL is sent
- [ ] `example.com/article` is accepted and sent as `https://example.com/article`
- [ ] On Add: the dialog closes, the confirmation screen opens, and the card shows
      a spinner then a checkmark — processing started before any tap on Save
- [ ] The folder row is usable while that spinner is running
- [ ] Save closes the screen and leaves exactly one item (no second job)
- [ ] X removes the item, both while it is processing and once it is done
- [ ] Cancel, then "+" → "Paste a link" again: the field is empty, not a leftover draft
- [ ] With the interface language set to Arabic, the address stays left-to-right

- [ ] Transcribing shows "Transcribing audio to text..." with spinner
- [ ] Ready transcript shows green checkmark and "Transcript is ready"
- [ ] Failed transcript shows red icon and "Transcript processing failed"
- [ ] Failed transcript shows "Refresh status" retry button (48px min height)
- [ ] Tapping retry refreshes the status from the server

### Processing Failed Banner (AC#4)
- [ ] When processing_job.status is "failed", red banner is visible
- [ ] Banner shows error message from backend (or generic fallback)
- [ ] "Refresh" button in banner is tappable (48px)
- [ ] Tapping Refresh re-fetches media status

---

## 4. AI Artifacts (AC#5)

### Artifacts Toggle

### Generate Actions
- [ ] Each artifact row (Summary, Flashcards, Learning Notes) has icon + label
- [ ] "Generate" button is visible for idle artifacts when media is ready

## 8. Failed Imports: Marker and Source Request (task-381)

Run the whole section on **both** an iOS and an Android device: nothing here is
platform-gated, so a difference between the two is a bug.

To produce a failure on one of the seven requestable codes, share a **direct link
to an image file** (e.g. a `…/foo.jpg` URL) — the article worker fetches it, sees
`image/jpeg` and refuses it as `NOT_AN_ARTICLE_PAGE`. This is the same source
`MD-25` of `docs/testing/manual-e2e-validation-matrix.md` uses. An Instagram photo
post no longer serves here: since task-384 it is ingested through the text of its
images and succeeds. For a code *outside* the list, share a **deleted or private
YouTube video** (`MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE`).

### Failure Marker on the Vignettes
- [ ] After the image-file link fails, the Library row for it shows a red FAILED pill next to its type badge
- [ ] The pill is legible on a VIDEO / SHORT row too, where the type badge is itself reddish
- [ ] The same item's tile in Home > "Recently added" shows the marker over its cover
- [ ] A tile in Home > "Continue learning" never shows the marker
- [ ] A folder tile never shows the marker
- [ ] A row that is still processing, and a row that succeeded, look exactly as before (no marker, same height)
- [ ] Type a query that matches the failed item: the search hit shows **no** marker (a hit carries no status)
- [ ] With VoiceOver / TalkBack on, the failed row and the failed tile each announce the failure once, inside their single label
- [ ] No horizontal overflow on a 320px viewport with the marker present

### Source Request Block (media detail, failed state)
- [ ] Opening the failed image-file item shows, under the error sentence and the Refresh button, a card reading "This media source isn't supported yet."
- [ ] The card carries exactly one button, "Request this source", at least 48px tall
- [ ] Neither the source URL nor any failure code appears anywhere on the screen
- [ ] Opening the failed YouTube item (`MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE`) shows the error sentence and Refresh, and **no** card
- [ ] The card looks and behaves identically on iOS and on Android
- [ ] Tapping the button disables it and shows a spinner with "Sending..."
- [ ] On success the button is replaced by a checkmark and "Request sent. Thank you!", and is no longer tappable
- [ ] The card does not change height between the button and the confirmation
- [ ] Leaving the screen and coming back offers the button again (the sent state is not persisted — by design)
- [ ] With airplane mode on, tapping the button shows the network error sentence and the button becomes tappable again
- [ ] Tapping it a sixth time within an hour shows "Too many requests. Please wait a moment and try again."
- [ ] With the interface language set to Arabic, the card's text is right-to-left and the marker sits on the correct side of the cover
