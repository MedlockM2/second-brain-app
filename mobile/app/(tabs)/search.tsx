 * movement and the gesture then belongs entirely to the `RefreshControl`,
 * where `interactive` would spend a downward drag re-raising the keyboard.

 * reasons. First, the two halves come from two independent requests, and the
 * requirement is that a failure of one leaves the other usable: side by side in
 * one scroll, the error card sits *next to* the half that worked instead of
 * hiding behind a tab nobody has a reason to open. Second, a segmented control
 * would be a second bar of chrome directly under the floating search pill,
 * spending the top of the screen on navigation on a screen whose whole job is to
 * show what you saved. The cost of this choice is that a user with many
 * folders scrolls past them to reach the media — acceptable, because the
 * grid is three tiles wide and the list is what the scroll is for.
