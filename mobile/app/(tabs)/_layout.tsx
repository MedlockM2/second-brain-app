/**
 * Protected tabs layout, and the enforcement point of the two invariants that
 * hold for every tab: a session, and a reading language.
 *
 * Both guards are checked in order, and both replace the tab bar entirely rather
 * than rendering it alongside a redirect — that is what makes them impossible to
 * walk past. `app/index.tsx` checks the same two things on a cold start, but it
 * is a route like any other: expo-router's `Redirect` only fires from a focus
 * effect, so an unfocused `index` keeps an unconsumed redirect armed and fires
 * it whenever it regains focus. That is how a fresh account used to reach the
 * tabs first and get the language screen thrown at it later, on an arbitrary tap
 * (task-326). Here there is nothing to arm: no tab exists until both guards pass.
 *
 * Tab bar follows the mockup navigation pattern (Home, Search, Digest, Account).
 *
 * The bar itself is no longer drawn here (task-350). `NativeTabs` hands the four
 * items to `UITabBarController` on iOS and to Material's bottom navigation on
 * Android, and that is the whole of what buys the iOS 26 floating glass capsule:
 * a detached, fully rounded bar inset from the screen edges, translucent, with
 * the content passing under it and the selected item in a filled pill. It is not
 * a design to redraw — it *is* the system bar — and it arrives with the
 * scroll-edge effect, Dynamic Type, the minimize behaviours and next year's
 * appearance, none of which a JS bar would ever stop owing.
 *
 * The price is that the background stops being ours to set: under Liquid Glass
 * the system owns it, and `backgroundColor`, `blurEffect`, `shadowColor` and
 * `disableTransparentOnScrollEdge` apply on iOS 18 and earlier only. So none of
 * them is passed, and on an iOS 18 device the classic opaque bar is the expected
 * rendering rather than a regression.
 *
 * `NativeTabs` is alpha and its API is stated as subject to change. Two known
 * upstream bugs surface here and are not local ones, so they are named rather
 * than chased: expo/expo#44029 (`labelStyle` colours not applying on iOS, which
 * is why the labels take their colour from `tintColor` and nothing sets
 * `labelStyle`) and expo/expo#39930 (icon tint not refreshing over light/dark
 * content on iOS 26).
