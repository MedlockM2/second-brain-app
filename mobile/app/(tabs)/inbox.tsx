/**
 * Home screen — the unsorted review entry point and two horizontal
 * rows of tiles: "Recently added" and "Continue learning" (task-307).
 *
 * The vertical list of every media item that used to live here is gone: task-306
 * moved the full library to the Search tab, which is where a list of everything
 * belongs. What is left is a landing screen — what just arrived, and what you
 * were in the middle of — and it is deliberately short.
 *
 * The Daily Digest card that used to sit at the top is gone too (task-324): it
 * pushed the Digest tab, which is one tap away in the tab bar. Its place is now
 * held by the entry into the triage of the default folder, which is the one
 * thing on this screen with a backlog behind it.
 *
 * Two sources feed it and each fails alone: "Recently added" comes from the
 * media list `useMediaList` holds, while `useHomeSections` brings the
 * engagement row and the folders behind the unsorted count. Only the very
 * first media fetch may show a full-screen spinner; no row ever shows one,
 * because a row with nothing to say is simply absent.
 *
 * The media list re-reads itself while a tile of "Recently added" is still being
 * processed, and stops as soon as none is (`useProcessingRefresh`, task-405): a
 * media shared from another app used to keep its loading marker until the user
 * opened it and came back.
 *
 * Also hosts the ingestion gestures (task-264): a camera button that shoots
 * straight away, and an "add" button opening the choice between a link, a file
 * and a gallery photo (task-379). All four hand the result to the share
 * confirmation screen, which asks the one question left — whether to file it in
 * a folder — over a run already under way: since task-389 none of the four waits
 * for a tap to be sent.

 * system lays out itself (task-350).
 *
 * On iOS 26 the bar is a capsule detached from the screen edges with the content
 * passing under it, and this screen's `SafeAreaView` takes `edges={["top"]}`, so
 * the safe area runs all the way to the screen bottom — the 24 pt the buttons
 * used to sit at now lands *inside* the glass. `TouchTarget.large` is the strip
 * the capsule itself needs, and it is the same 64 the deleted Android branch of
 * `tabBarStyle` gave a bottom bar; `Spacing.lg` is the gap the capsule floats
 * above the screen bottom plus the room that keeps the buttons visibly off it
 * rather than tangent to it.

 * The entry into the triage of the default folder — variant **F, "Layering

 * (the second round, in `code2.html`), retained by the owner on 2026-09-07 with
 * no requested deviation.
 *
 * Nothing waiting, nothing to show: at zero the card is absent from the screen
 * altogether rather than sitting there inert with a `0` on it. A card offering
 * to sort an empty queue is one more thing to read on a landing screen that is
 * deliberately short.
 *
 * **The shape says the destination.** Two tonal plates peek out of the card's
 * bottom-end corner, so what waits reads as a deck to go through — DESIGN.md's
 * Layering Principle applied literally ("use the `surface-container` tiers to
 * stack information"), with the theme's own surfaces rather than a tint of the
 * card's own. Nothing here survives from the Daily Digest card that used to hold
 * this slot: the hairline border is gone (the No-Line rule calls a full-width
 * frame a "broad layout division"), `Shadows.soft` is gone (it was on three of
 * this screen's four interactive surfaces, so it distinguished nothing), and so
 * is `file-tray-outline` — which is the glyph of the very tab this card sits in,
 * and a piece of 20th-century office furniture the product does not handle.
 *
 * The count is a sticker on the icon plate instead of a chip in a trailing
 * cluster, and the chevron sits on a `textMain` disc instead of floating in pale
 * amber: the two corrections the second round of the mockup was made for.
 *
 * Two things the plates deliberately do *not* have, because the mockup flags
 * this variant as the most decorative of its round and the plates sit right
 * above the real media tiles: no shadow and no amber. They are tonal shifts of
 * the background, which keeps the deck an announcement over the list rather than
 * a fourth tile inside it.
 *
 * The three plates are declared back-to-front, because React Native paints
 * siblings in tree order. The two rear ones are absolute against the pressable's
 * own box and the front surface gives up the margin they show through, so no
 * plate ever escapes the card — and `start`/`end` mirror the whole deck in RTL
 * for free.
