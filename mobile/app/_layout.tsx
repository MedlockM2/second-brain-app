 * stayed attached for good; the share modal was presented above it and saved
 * correctly, and closing the modal dropped the user back onto a root view still
 * hidden behind the splash, with no way out (iOS beta feedback on build 4).
 *
 * Two gates decide when there is something to show, and both sit above this
 * component: `I18nProvider` renders null until the stored interface language is
 * read, and `AuthProvider` starts out loading. Past those, every route renders a
 * surface of its own — content, a redirect, or its spinner on
 * `Colors.background` — and the effect only runs once that render is committed,

 *    Outermost of our own providers because every one of them can end up
 *    producing a visible surface, the startup error screen included.
 * 3. I18nProvider - resolves the interface language (device locale, or the
 *    in-app override read from the device) before anything renders a word of
 *    it.
 * 4. AuthProvider - manages authentication state.
 * 5. UserPreferencesProvider - manages the account preferences the backend
 *    stores: the reading language, and the device time zone it reports on every
 *    foreground pass so the Digest can fire at 18:30 local time.
 * 6. PurchasesProvider - manages IAP state.
