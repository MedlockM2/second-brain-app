/**
 * Paywall screen showing the subscription tiers with native purchase buttons.
 *
 * Displays RevenueCat offerings and handles the purchase flow including
 * success, cancellation, pending (Ask to Buy), and error states.
 *
 * **Where the figures come from.** Nothing about a plan is written in this file.
 * The tiers, their allowances, their per-import ceilings and the trial terms are
 * fetched from `GET /api/pricing` — the backend pricing config itself — and
 * turned into sentences by `src/lib/planCopy.ts`; **every price comes from the
 * store package and nowhere else**. Until task-299 the same numbers lived here,
 * in `entitlements.py` and in the config at once, and this screen was the copy
 * that had gone stale. No figure is quoted here, not even in prose.
 *
 * What separates the tiers is volume on two axes and nothing else: the minutes a
 * month (`minutes_per_month`) and the longest single import (`max_minutes_per_item`).
 * There is no capability a tier withholds — so the header may say every plan does
 * everything, provided it says "how much you send" and not "how many minutes",
 * which would name only the first axis and leave the ceiling unannounced.
 *
 * **What the screen puts first.** The plans. An earlier version opened with a
 * tagline, a sub-tagline and four benefit lines — roughly 600px of argument —
 * so on a 6.1" phone the first price was below the fold and on a 4.7" one no
 * card was on screen at all. A purchase screen that hides its prices until you
 * scroll is arguing with someone who has already decided to look. The order is
 * now: one short promise, the refusal you are standing in (if any), the three
 * plans, then the evidence — what you can send, and what sending it costs.
 *
 * **Everything is flat.** There is no disclosure. The exhaustive version of
 * "what is included" used to hide behind a toggle two taps below the prices,
 * where the only place the screen admitted the app is not an audio-only product
 * was a bullet nobody expanded (task-377). What replaced it says more in less
 * room, because neither block is prose: a row of chips naming the platforms and
 * formats accepted, and a table of what each kind of import debits.
 *
 * **Names, never logos.** The chips carry text in one uniform size. Apple,
 * TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram and Spotify each forbid in writing exactly what a
 * row of competitors' logos on a screen selling a subscription would be, and a
 * pictogram that resembles a logo is worse still — it is an imitation. If a
 * visual mark is ever wanted here it has to be generic and ours.
 *
 * **What the screen may claim.** Only checkable facts. The recommended plan is
 * derived from minutes the account actually spent, "best value" is arithmetic on
 * the store's own prices, and there is no "most popular" badge because with no
 * users that would simply be false. See `buildPlanGuidance`.
 *
 * **There is no Restore Purchases button**, and adding one back would be a
 * regression (task-336). The subscription follows the *app account*, not the
 * store account: `identifyUser()` logs the user in to RevenueCat under their own
 * id, and access is read from `GET /api/entitlements/status`, so a reinstall or a
 * new device recovers it by signing in. The button could only ever restore what
 * the account already had — and it read its verdict from RevenueCat while the
 * paywall reads the backend, so it could announce "Purchases restored" on a
 * screen that then refused to close.
