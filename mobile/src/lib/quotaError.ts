/**
 * Client-side reading of the backend consumption contract.

 * A refused submission answers with the `X-Quota-Error-Code` header (see
 * `media_summarizer/core/services/quota_enforcer.py`) plus a typed body holding
 * the *figures* behind the refusal — never the sentence. The sentence is built
 * here, from this app's catalogue, because the server has no idea which of the
 * eleven interface languages the reader chose. Two codes exist, because there
 * are only two reasons an import can be refused, and the difference between them
 * is whether upgrading fixes it:
 *
 * - `out_of_minutes` — the period's minutes are spent, or there is no plan at
 *   all (`has_plan: false`). Upgrading buys more.
 * - `item_too_long` — this single item is longer than one import may use on this
 *   plan. Splitting it fixes it; upgrading is not the answer, so no paywall.
