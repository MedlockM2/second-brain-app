/**
 * The net under a JavaScript error that happens outside a React render.
 *
 * A React error boundary only ever sees what breaks *while rendering*. Everything
 * else — a `throw` in a timer or a native callback, a rejected promise, a `throw`
 * inside an asynchronous effect — reaches React Native's global handler instead,
 * and that handler's release behaviour for a *fatal* error is to call through to
 * `ExceptionsManager` → `RCTFatal`, which aborts the process. That is the
 * `SIGABRT` in the crash report attached to a beta feedback on build 1.0.0 (6): a
 * process iOS had prewarmed in the background, with no interface role, that lived
 * a minute and then aborted from the exception bridge. Nobody saw it, because
 * there was no window — but the system counts those crashes and prewarms an app
 * that keeps aborting less often, which is paid back as latency the next time the
 * share sheet has to open.
 *
 * Two hooks are installed, because they see different things:
 *
 * 1. `ErrorUtils.setGlobalHandler` — every uncaught throw that reaches the
 *    runtime. A fatal one is recorded here and *not* forwarded in a release
 *    build, so `StartupErrorGate` can swap the tree for a readable fallback
 *    instead of the process dying.
 * 2. Hermes' promise rejection tracker — rejections nobody handled. React Native
 *    installs this one itself, but only under `__DEV__`
 *    (`Libraries/Core/polyfillPromise.js`), so without this hook an unhandled
 *    rejection in a release build would be entirely silent.
 *
 * **This module is the only owner of both hooks, Sentry included.**
 * `@sentry/react-native` reaches for the same two hooks, in the same order, for
 * the same reason — and installing both would break the fallback whichever way
 * they stacked (the reasons are spelled out in `crashReporting.ts`). So Sentry's
 * own handlers are switched off at init, and everything caught here is sent to
 * Sentry from `logStartupFailure`, plus the non-fatal errors that pass straight
 * through. Nothing about when the fallback shows has changed.
 *
 * **A rejection is logged, never shown.** It does not end the process, and the
 * app is full of deliberate fire-and-forget calls whose failure is recoverable:
 * `AuthContext` schedules a token refresh with `void scheduleRefresh()`, which
 * reads the keychain, and a keychain read is exactly what a *locked* device
 * refuses — the state the observed prewarm was in. Turning that into a
 * full-screen error the user meets on their next launch would be a worse bug than
 * the one this module fixes. So the fallback is reserved for the errors that
 * would otherwise kill the process, and the rejections go to the log and to
 * Sentry, which is more than they had before.
 *
 * Installed from the module scope of `app/_layout.tsx`, next to the splash hold,
 * so it is armed before any provider mounts and for every entry point at once —
 * including a cold start driven by a share, which `+native-intent.tsx` rewrites
 * to `/(tabs)/inbox` and which therefore never mounts the `/` route.
