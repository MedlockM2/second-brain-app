 * a folder holds are out of scope.
 *
 * Callers pass the flat `nodeById` values of `buildFolderTree`, so a nested
 * folder surfaces exactly like a root one. The default folder is matched on the
 * label the user has actually seen — the translated `getDefaultFolderLabel()`,
 * never its stored `Uncategorized` name — and is returned carrying that label,
 * so a French user finds it by typing "non classé".
