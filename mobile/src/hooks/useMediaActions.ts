/**
 * The behaviour behind the actions menu of a media item: which media it targets,
 * where "Move" goes, what "Rename" writes, and what "Delete" actually does.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in the menu component so every surface offering those
 * actions shares one implementation of the destructive path and of the rename
 * instead of three that can drift apart: the `All media` list of the library tab,
 * the sources list inside a folder, and the `…` in the header of a media
 * item's own page. Each surface only supplies what it alone knows — how to drop a
 * row from the list it holds and how to put a new title on one, or, on a detail
 * screen holding no list, how to leave once the thing it shows is gone.
 *
 * `useFolderActions` is the sibling of this hook for a folder, and both
 * feed the same `AnchoredContextMenu` and the same `RenameDialog`.
 *
 * Moving is delegated whole to the existing `/media/folder` picker: it takes
 * `mediaItemId` / `currentFolderId`, creates a folder on the fly, and
 * issues the `PATCH /api/media/:id` itself. Every caller refetches on focus, so
 * the surface already reflects the move by the time the picker is popped — there
 * is nothing to report back. Renaming is the opposite case: it never leaves the
 * screen, so the new title is handed back to the surface directly.
