/**
 * The two things the app owes the push notification path: a registered device,
 * and somewhere to land when a notification is opened.
 *
 * Registration is attempted once per signed-in account, and retried on every
 * return to the foreground until it succeeds. The retry costs one permission
 * *read* — it can never re-prompt, the service holds that invariant — and it is
 * what recovers the two everyday failures: the device was offline when the
 * account signed in, and the user granted the permission afterwards in the system
 * settings. Same shape and same reasons as `useDeviceTimezoneSync`.
 *
 * A refusal ends the attempt and nothing else. No state is exposed, no screen
 * reads this hook, and there is no interface anywhere that behaves differently
 * for a user who said no.
