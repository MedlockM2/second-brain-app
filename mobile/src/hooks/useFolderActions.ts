/**
 * The behaviour behind the actions menu of a folder — the long press on its
 * tile in Library, and the `…` in the header of its own page: what "Rename"
 * writes, and what "Delete" actually takes with it.
 *
 * The sibling of `useMediaActions`, deliberately shaped the same way and feeding
 * the same two surfaces — `AnchoredContextMenu` for the menu,`RenameDialog` for
 * the field. Two rows here where a media has three: a folder has no "Move",
 * because moving one to another parent is a different gesture with a different
 * picker, and offering it as a row would promise a destination this menu has no
 * way to ask for.
 *
 * The default folder never reaches this hook. The backend refuses to rename
 * or delete it (`folder_service.update_folder` / `delete_folder` both raise on
 * `is_default`), so neither its tile nor its page carries the menu at all — a
 * menu whose two rows would both fail is worse than no menu.
