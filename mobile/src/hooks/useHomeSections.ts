/**
 * The two data sources the Home screen owns beyond its media list.
 *
 * The point of the hook is *independence*. Several screens' worth of content
 * share one scroll view, and a folders endpoint that 500s must not take the
 * engagement row down with it, nor blank the media list that `useMediaList`
 * fetches separately. So each source keeps its own state and its own failure,
 * and a failure resolves to "this section has nothing", never to an exception
 * crossing into another one.
 *
 * Neither exposes a loading flag on purpose: no section here may render a
 * spinner. A row with nothing to show is simply absent, which is the same thing
 * the screen does for an empty row and therefore needs no extra state.
 *
 * The folders are fetched for one reason only: they carry their own
 * `media_count`, which is where the unsorted review button's figure comes from
 * (task-324) — the Home no longer calls the digest endpoint just to put a number
 * on a card.
