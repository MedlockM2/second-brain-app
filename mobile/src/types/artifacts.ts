/**
 * Wire types of the scope-addressed artifact API.
 *
 * Artifacts are an append-only history per scope: a scope holds several entries
 * of the same type, each carrying the snapshot of the sources it was generated
 * over. There is no "current artifact of type X" anywhere in these shapes, which
 * is the whole point — the concept stopped existing backend-side too.
 *
 * A new entry only appears when the set of sources differs from every entry
 * already stored (task-322): a media item therefore holds one entry per type for
 * good, and a folder gains one each time its contents change. The `sources`
 * snapshot of an entry is what a screen compares against the folder's
 * current contents to know whether generating again would produce anything.
