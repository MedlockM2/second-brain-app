/**
 * Provider that consumes the official expo-share-intent package context
 * and maps its resolved ShareIntent data to our app's ShareIntakeState.
 *
 * The expo-share-intent package handles:
 * - Intercepting scheme URLs (media-summarizer://dataUrl=<key>?nonce=...)
 * - Resolving data from iOS App Groups via the native module
 * - Listening for Android intent data
 * - App state transitions (foreground/background reset)
 *
 * This provider handles:
 * - Auth gating (queues intent while unauthenticated)
 * - Mapping the package's ShareIntent shape to our ShareIntakeState
 * - Navigation to the share-confirmation screen
 * - Submission logic (ingest URL, text, or audio to backend)
 *
 * Since task-378 a reception is submitted the moment it is mapped, and since
 * task-389 that holds for all three of them, local imports included: the seconds
 * the user spends answering the modal are seconds of processing already under
 * way. The confirmation screen therefore stands in front of a save that already
 * exists and asks one thing, whether to file it — which is why folder patching
 * lives here: it must survive the screen being closed while a call is still in
 * flight.
 *
 * Since task-379 it also holds the third way a URL can arrive: typed or pasted in
 * the app, from the "+" menu of the Home screen. It goes through this provider
 * rather than straight to `MediaService` so it inherits the whole of the above —
 * the auth replay, the automatic start, the folder patching — and differs from a
 * share in exactly one thing, the `source_app` it reports.
 *
 * Must be placed inside AuthProvider and the package's ShareIntentProvider.
