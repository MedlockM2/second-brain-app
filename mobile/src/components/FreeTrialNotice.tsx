/**
 * The one place the app says a free trial is running: a small centred notice at
 * the top of the inbox, counting the days left.
 *
 * Until task-301 nothing on any screen contained the word trial — `is_free_trial`
 * was declared on the entitlement payload and read by no one — so a trial looked
 * exactly like a paid plan whose "period ends" on a date the user read as the day
 * their access stopped. It is that date; the fix is to say so.
 *
 * The notice reports, it never decides. Whether a trial is running is
 * `is_free_trial` from the backend and never a date comparison made here; the
 * countdown is presentation of `resets_at`, which after task-300 is the trial's
 * closing instant. The app is not told when the trial opened and does not try to
 * reconstruct its length: one date in, one countdown out.

 *   access is still granted, exactly as "1 day left" would be for the eleven
 *   hours before the close. That day says "last day" instead, which is true for
 *   the whole of it. Every other figure is a real number of days: 1 means the
 *   trial closes tomorrow.
 * - **No date.** `resets_at` is nullable on the payload. The trial is still
 *   running — the backend said so — so the notice stays, without a countdown it
