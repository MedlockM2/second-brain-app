/**
 * The translucent backdrop of the surfaces in the app that ask for one: the
 * floating search pill of the library screen, the card of the media context menu,
 * the round back and `…` buttons over a media's cover, and the two strips of text
 * laid over a cover (`MediaDetailHero`'s title band, `DigestCoverStack`'s
 * caption).
 *
 * Two things this component does not give its caller, and both have already cost
 * a bug:
 *
 * - **No contrast.** Every branch below is translucent, and the iOS 26 one adapts
 *   to what it covers, so none of them guarantees any opacity at all. Over
 *   scrolling content — the pill and the menu card, what this was written for —
 *   that is fine, because the page under it is a known light tone. Over a
 *   photograph it is not: the title band came up as dark text on bare leaves
 *   until it painted `Colors.coverTitleVeil` over the material itself. A caller
 *   that lays text on a picture owns its own contrast floor.
 * - **No tolerance for alpha.** An `opacity` below 1 on the surface, or on any of
 *   its ancestors, stops the material rendering at all, and `expo-glass-effect`
 *   installs the effect on the view's first layout pass only — so a surface that
 *   was ever laid out invisible stays an untinted empty box. There is therefore no
 *   alpha a surface can be faded through, and no wrapper that can be faded around
 *   one: a caller keeps the surface out of the tree until it is meant to be seen,
 *   and fully opaque for as long as it is in it. Whatever appearance it wants then
 *   goes on a transform, which leaves the effect alone, or on the children drawn
 *   over the material, which the constraint does not reach — `AnchoredContextMenu`
 *   opens its menu card on both, and is the shape to copy. `MediaDetailHero`'s
 *   title band is the site that paid for this one: it was hidden at `opacity: 0`
 *   while its title was being measured, and came up an untinted box whenever the
 *   measure lost the race.
 *
 * Three branches, and none of them is a degradation of the one above — each is
 * the best material the platform can actually draw:
 *
 * 1. **Liquid Glass** (`GlassView`, `glassEffectStyle="regular"`), the iOS 26
 *    material, and the one the system tab bar these surfaces sit next to draws
 *    since task-350. Both availability checks have to pass, and the second is
 *    not redundant: `isLiquidGlassAvailable()` only reports that the app is
 *    drawing the Liquid Glass design, while `isGlassEffectAPIAvailable()`
 *    reports that the API exists on this device — some iOS 26 betas ship without
 *    it and calling into it crashes (expo/expo#40911).
 * 2. **The iOS 18 blur** (`BlurView`, light) on any other iOS. That is the
 *    material those versions have and the appearance they are meant to keep, not
 *    a fallback for a glass that failed. The two call sites had drifted apart
 *    before they shared this component — the pill blurred at 60, the menu card at
 *    80 under a white veil standing in for vibrancy — and one setting is now what
 *    both of them get.
 * 3. **An opaque tint** everywhere else. Android blur support is uneven across
 *    devices and vendors — and silently degrades when the system disables
 *    animations — so Android takes the tint rather than risk a surface that
 *    renders as nothing over scrolling content. It therefore never reaches
 *    branch 2, which is why nothing here configures `experimentalBlurMethod`.
 *    iOS lands here too when the user has asked for less transparency: the doc
 *    of `isLiquidGlassAvailable` states that it reports component availability
 *    only and stays `true` when an accessibility setting limits the effect,
 *    pointing at `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceTransparencyEnabled()` for the rest.
 *    A glass pill under reduce transparency is exactly the unreadable surface
 *    this branch exists to avoid, so that flag sends both iOS branches here.
 *
 * The caller owns the shape: the radius, the height and the padding all come
 * from the `style` it passes, and that style has to keep `overflow: "hidden"` so
 * the radius clips whichever material renders.
