/**
 * The tile of the Home screen's two horizontal rows (task-307).
 *
 * One component for "Continue learning" and "Recently added" alike: a large
 * cover, the title on up to three lines, the creator on one muted line. There is
 * no type badge and no timestamp — the rows are short and ordered, so neither
 * earns its space, and dropping them is what lets the title breathe. The two
 * exceptions are both about where an import stands, which is the one thing about
 * a tile that the user cannot find out by looking at it: a failed one is marked
 * over the cover (task-381), and one still on its way is swept by a blurred band
 * with the state in its subtitle (task-402). Exactly one of the two can show at
 * a time — see `tileStatusMarker`.
 *
 * Its height is fixed (`TILE_HEIGHT`) rather than driven by its own text, so the
 * row it sits in is the same height whichever kinds of tile it holds — see the
 * constant's comment for what that was breaking on the Home screen.
 *
 * The cover is 16:9 and cropped with `contentFit="cover"`, the ratio validated
 * by the task-302 benchmark (§6.4): it matches the two highest-volume sources
 * (YouTube, `og:image`) and keeps every tile the same height. It is rendered
 * with `expo-image` for the three props §6.1-6.2 selected it for — a `cacheKey`
 * that survives the rotating signature of a re-hosted cover, a `recyclingKey` so
 * a recycled cell never shows the previous tile's picture, and an explicit
 * `memory-disk` policy.
 *
 * With no cover — or when loading one fails — the media-type glyph is drawn on
 * `surfaceContainerLow`. There is no third state: the empty grey rectangle at
 * `digest.tsx` is the anti-pattern the benchmark names by name (§6.3).
 */

/**
 * Layout of the row, in one place because these three numbers are what decides
 * whether the next tile peeks at the right edge — which is the only thing
 * telling the user the row scrolls at all.
 *
 * 200 wide with a 16 px gutter puts the second tile's left edge at x=232. On the
 * narrowest phone this app targets (375 pt) that leaves ~143 pt of it visible,
 * and ~158 pt on a 390 pt screen: cut in both cases, never flush.

 *
 * A tile that sized itself to its content made the row size itself to whichever
 * tile happened to be tallest, and the gap the Home screen declares below a row
 * was then measured from that one tile. Two things make tiles disagree: a
 * folder tile always carries a subtitle (its item count) where a media tile
 * without a creator carries none, and a three-line title stands 40 dp taller than
 * a one-line one. So a row holding one media tile beside one folder tile left
 * a void under the media tile ~20 dp deeper than declared, and the next heading
 * read as pushed away. Reserving the worst case — three title lines plus one
 * subtitle line — makes the row's height independent of the kinds it holds, so
 * the gap between two Home blocks means what `inbox.tsx` says it means.
 *
 * Text stays top-aligned, so a short tile carries its slack at the bottom, where
 * it is the same on every tile of the row. The line heights are explicit for the
 * same reason the height is fixed: a height computed from tokens is only exact if
 * the text cannot pick its own leading. Android font padding may still spend a dp
 * or two past the box; nothing is clipped, and the tile's layout height is
 * constant either way, which is all the row's rhythm depends on.
