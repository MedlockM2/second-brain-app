/**
 * The one marker that says an import failed, wherever a saved media is drawn as a
 * vignette (task-381).
 *
 * `MediaListItem.status` has always been served by `GET /api/media` and was read
 * nowhere: a media that failed looked exactly like one that succeeded in the
 * Library and on Home, and the only way to find out was to open it. This is what
 * closes that gap, and it is one component for the same reason `getMediaTypeIcon`
 * is one function — two copies of a badge is how the same item ends up looking
 * failed on one screen and fine on the next.
 *
 * Filled `error`, not `errorContainer`. The soft red container is already the
 * background `getMediaTypeBadgeTones` gives the VIDEO and SHORT type badges, and a
 * second pill of that exact tint sitting beside one of them reads as a second type
 * rather than as an alarm.
 *
 * Both surfaces mark themselves `accessible={false}`: the row and the tile each
 * announce their own failure inside their single label (see `describeWithFailure`),
 * so a screen reader must not also stop on the pill and read "FAILED" twice.
