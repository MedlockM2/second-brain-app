/**
 * A media item that has finished processing, as a page.
 *
 * The hero title and its metadata, then two intra-screen tabs: the transcript
 * ("Reader") and artifact generation ("AI"). Everything it shows comes from the
 * `mediaData` prop — it reads no route parameter and holds no polling of its
 * own, so the same component renders the `/media/[id]` route and a card of the
 * Digest pager. That is the point of it living here rather than in the route:
 * a change to the media page lands in both by construction.
 *
 * The route keeps what belongs to a route: the fetch, and the loading,
 * processing, timeout and failure states of the item on its way here.
 *
 * `useRouter()` stays — the folder picker and an artifact are pushed the
 * same way from a route as from a pager. What does not stay is any read of the
 * URL segment.
