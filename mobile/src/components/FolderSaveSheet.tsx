/**
 * "Which folder?" for the unsorted-review triage, presented as a sheet.
 *
 * The body is `FolderPickerView` — the same search, the same tree, the same
 * inline creation the share flow and the media detail screen open. The one
 * deliberate omission is the "Unsorted" destination: every card in the triage
 * queue already sits in the default folder, so offering to put it back there
 * would be a no-op dressed as a decision. Everything else about the picker is
 * shared, and a change to it lands in all three places at once.
 *
 * A plain RN `<Modal transparent animationType="slide">` on the `AddSourceSheet`
 * pattern, deliberately not a router screen. It is rendered *from inside* a
 * full-screen route modal, and a React Native modal is presented above whatever
 * is on screen without a navigator having to nest one presentation inside
 * another — which is exactly what makes this shape available to a screen that is
 * itself a modal. The panel takes nearly the full height so the list has the
 * same room it has as a screen.
 *
 * Unlike the picker's screen host, a tap here *is* the answer: the assignment
 * goes out immediately and the sheet closes. There is no Save button because
 * there is nothing to come back to — the media leaves the queue.
