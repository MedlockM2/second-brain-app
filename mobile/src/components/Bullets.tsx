/**
 * A bulleted list, either dotted or ticked.
 *
 * Extracted from the artifact screen, which is where it grew and where it is
 * still used the most: the triage card of "Tri des non classés" renders the same
 * kind of list, and two hand-rolled bullet styles drifting apart is exactly what
 * a design system exists to prevent.
 *
 * `numberOfLines` is what the triage screen adds: there the card must fit the
 * screen with no scroll of its own, so a bullet that runs long is clipped rather
 * than allowed to push the action bar away. It is a safety net — the prompt bounds
 * bullet length upstream — and the artifact screen, which scrolls freely, leaves
 * it unset. The cap is the caller's to work out, not this component's: the triage
 * card measures what its box can hold and passes the answer down.
