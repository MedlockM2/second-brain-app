/**
 * The screen title bar, in one place.
 *
 * Native headers are off everywhere (`headerShown: false` in every `_layout`),
 * so each screen used to rebuild this row by hand — fourteen copies that had
 * drifted apart, most of them with a title that could not shrink. A title
 * without `flex` refuses to compress in a flex row: it runs *under* the action
 * button rather than being clipped, which is what "Save photo" did the moment
 * French turned "Save" into "Enregistrer".
 *
 * The contract here is the one that already worked in
 * `app/media/folders/[id].tsx`, made general:
 *
 *     [ leading: fixed ][ title: flex 1, centred, one line ][ trailing: intrinsic ]
 *
 * The title is the only element allowed to shrink, and it truncates rather
 * than wrapping — a header that grows a second line pushes the whole screen
 * down. Everything else keeps its natural width, so a long translation costs
 * an ellipsis and never a collision.
 *
 * On the optical centring: the title is centred in the space *left over*, so a
 * trailing button wider than the leading one shifts it by a few pixels. That
 * is deliberate. Measuring the trailing button with `onLayout` to mirror it
 * would buy those pixels for an extra render pass and a width that is wrong on
 * the first frame — and it is exactly the reasoning that produced the
 * hard-coded `width: 88` placeholder this component replaces, a number correct
 * in English and wrong in German.
 *
 * The two controls that fill those slots live here as well: `HeaderIconButton`
 * for a back or close, and `HeaderMenuButton` for the trailing `…`. The glyph of
 * the second is exported on its own: the media page draws its `…` on glass over
 * the cover (`MediaDetailHero`, task-411), a different control that must still
 * read as the same action.
