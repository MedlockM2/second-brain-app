/**
 * What a long press on something in Library opens: a context menu anchored to
 * the thing that was pressed, on the shape of the iOS Files menu.
 *
 * The pressed view is measured with `measureInWindow` at long-press time and the
 * rect is handed here, which is what makes the menu *anchored* rather than pinned
 * to the bottom edge: the card is placed just under the view, or just above it
 * when the view sits too low for the card to fit underneath. A copy of the view is
 * redrawn at that rect, slightly enlarged, above the blurred backdrop — so the
 * pressed thing and the menu are the only sharp things on screen and the gesture
 * visibly names its target.
 *
 * One component for every target, and deliberately so: a media row offers Move,
 * Rename and Delete, a folder tile offers Rename and Delete, and a second
 * file re-implementing the backdrop, the lifted preview and the up/down geometry
 * for the second of those is exactly what this generalization avoids. The target
 * is therefore a type parameter and the rows are data — an ordered list of
 * actions, from which the card's height is derived.
 *
 * Rebuilt in JS on purpose (task-346). A system `UIMenu` cannot be styled, and
 * the ready-made shape fails on two counts beyond that. `Link.Menu` and
 * `Link.Preview` do ship inside `expo-router`, but `LinkMenu` is annotated
 * `@platform ios`, so Android — the project's shipping path — would lose the long
 * press entirely; and a `UIMenu` dismisses itself the moment a row is selected,
 * which leaves nowhere for the in-flight spinner on Delete to live. The animation
 * needs no gesture library either: it is one scale-and-fade with no continuous
 * gesture, which the `Animated` API of React Native core does.
 *
 * That scale-and-fade is arranged around one constraint of the card's material,
 * and the arrangement is the point. `expo-glass-effect` draws nothing at all under
 * an `opacity` below 1 — on the glass view or on any view above it — and installs
 * its effect on the first layout pass only, so a card ever laid out faded comes up
 * an untinted box and stays one for as long as it is on screen. That is the defect
 * `MediaDetailHero`'s title band was reported for on 2026-09-29, on the same
 * material. So nothing above the material is given an opacity here, not even a
 * value picked for being high enough to survive: the card is mounted for exactly
 * the span of the animation — nothing renders while `visible` is false, and the
 * caller holds it true until the exit has played — and it is fully opaque on every
 * frame of it. What moves is the scale, which a transform carries without touching
 * the effect, and the fade sits on the rows drawn *over* the material, inside the
 * glass view where the constraint does not reach (the disabled rows already dim
 * themselves there). Nothing is left tuned to an alpha that the next version of the
 * library, or another screen density, could stop honouring.
 *
 * The orchestration — which thing is targeted, the destructive confirmation, the
 * network calls — belongs to `useMediaActions` / `useFolderActions`; this file
 * is the surface only.
