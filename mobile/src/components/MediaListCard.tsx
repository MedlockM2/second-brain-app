/**
 * Uniform media row for a vertical library list: the cover, the media type and
 * the age, the title, then the creator. Tapping it opens the media detail.
 *
 * The one media vignette of the Library tab, and deliberately the only one: the
 * list of everything saved and the list of search hits show the same items, and
 * two components drawing them were two apps (task-375). A search hit passes one
 * extra prop — the transcript excerpt that matched — and is otherwise this row.
 *
 * The second line holds `creator_name` and falls back to the source domain: five
 * sources can never have a creator (shared text, documents, audio files), and a
 * domain is the only other thing that says where the media comes from. The two
 * are never stacked — the row keeps a fixed height whatever the source.
 *
 * The cover is 16:9 and cropped with `contentFit="cover"`, the ratio validated
 * on the task-302 benchmark (§6.4): it matches the two highest-volume sources
 * (YouTube, `og:image`) and keeps every row the same height. It is rendered with
 * `expo-image` rather than React Native's `Image` for the three props that
 * benchmark selected it for (§6.1-6.2): a `cacheKey` that survives the rotating
 * signature of a re-hosted cover, a `recyclingKey` so a recycled row never shows
 * the previous item's picture, and an explicit `memory-disk` policy.
 *
 * With no cover — or when loading one fails — the media-type glyph is drawn on
 * `surfaceContainerLow`. There is no third state: an empty grey rectangle is the
 * anti-pattern the benchmark names (§6.3).
 *
 * The only processing state the row shows is the terminal one: a failed import
 * gets a marker beside its type badge (task-381). The stages on the way in are
 * deliberately absent — they resolve on their own within a minute or two, where a
 * failure is final and is the one thing worth knowing without opening the item.
