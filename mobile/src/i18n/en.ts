/**
 * The reference catalogue.
 *
 * `en` is the app's development language and its fallback, and it is what the
 * `TranslationKey` type is derived from: a key that is not here cannot be
 * passed to `t`, and a key that is here has to be present in all ten other
 * catalogues. Keys are flat and dot-namespaced by the screen or component that
 * owns them, with `common.*` for the words that recur everywhere.
 *
 * Plural families are spelled out as `<base>.one` / `<base>.other` and read
 * through `tCount`, which picks the category with `Intl.PluralRules` — never by
 * gluing a count onto a fixed suffix. A catalogue whose language needs more
 * categories (Arabic has six) simply declares them alongside.
