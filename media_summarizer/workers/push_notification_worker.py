"""Push notification consumer: hands a notification to Expo.

The delivery path chosen by task-368 and validated by the owner is **Option 1 —
Expo Push Service, one token per device, a single SQS consumer inside the
existing worker image, receipt checking driven by re-enqueueing the same queue
with ``DelaySeconds=900``**. This module is that consumer.

Expo, and not APNs and FCM directly, because a direct integration means holding
an APNs signing key and an FCM service account, minting JWTs, and writing two
payload dialects — for a push surface of two Digest notifications a week and one
line when a saved source becomes readable. Expo already holds the credentials the
EAS build was signed with.

**It knows nothing about what it is delivering.** A message names a title, a body,
an Android channel and a ``data`` blob; which of those a Digest and a ready source
put in them belongs to their producers (``workers/digest/scheduler.py`` and
``core/services/push_notification_dispatch.py``). Adding a third kind of
notification is a third producer, not a branch here.

**Two message shapes on one queue.** A ``send`` message names a user and the
notification to deliver; a ``receipt_check`` message names the tickets a previous
send produced. They share a queue because they share a consumer, and the second
is produced by the first with a fifteen-minute delay — the interval Expo
recommends before receipts are meaningful.

**Why receipts matter at all**, given the send already answers per token: the
immediate answer is a *ticket*, which only says Expo accepted the notification.
The verdict from APNs or FCM lands minutes later in a *receipt*, and that is
where an uninstalled app shows up as ``DeviceNotRegistered``. Reading receipts is
what keeps the token table from filling with devices that no longer exist.

**A failure raises.** The handler in ``workers/lambda_handlers.py`` turns that
into a batch item failure, SQS retries three times, and the message lands on the
DLQ. What is deliberately *not* retried: a per-token verdict. A rejected token is
either deleted (the device is gone) or logged (nothing a retry would change).

**No token is ever logged**, here or anywhere. Counts, platforms and Expo's own
error codes are; the token itself is a credential — anyone holding it can push to
that device — and it appears in no log line, no exception message and no metric.
``utils/logging_config.py`` redacts the field names as a net under that rule.
