"""
Queue-first Instagram ingestion worker.

This is the only place Instagram resolution runs (task-274). The API used to
resolve inline, which could not work: yt-dlp plus, on an IP block, an Apify run
measured at 63-100 s never fit the 30 s ceiling API Gateway imposes on the
request, so every save timed out with nothing persisted while the actor run was
billed and discarded.

Pipeline:
- Consumes messages from INSTAGRAM_INGESTION_QUEUE
- Resolves content via InstagramApifyResolver (yt-dlp first, Apify Reel/Post
  Scrapers on an IP block)
- For reels: enqueues a Deepgram transcription job pointing at the resolved
  audio URL (or video URL fallback) with deepgram_mode="push" -- Instagram CDNs
  block Deepgram's pull, so the Deepgram worker downloads the bytes and posts
  them itself. Carries the derived title (task-266) and the Instagram quota
  category, and nothing descriptive: the caption stays on the job, under
  extraction_metadata.resolver_metadata.caption, which is where the artifact
  corpus reads it (task-383).
- Image posts (single and carousel): every image of the post is downloaded on the
  Apify callback and OCR'd through the shared parsing chain
  (`core/services/document_parsing_service.py`, LlamaParse then Unstructured).
  The concatenated text is the transcript, one section per image, and the job
  completes like any other source. When no image yields a word, the caption
  becomes the transcript instead (task-384).
- Fails terminally when no audio URL is available.
- Marks the processing job as extracting/transcribing along the way.
