"""
Media completed events consumer -- content ledger close, watcher fan-out, indexing.

- Consumes events from EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE (episode-completed-events-<env>)
- Canonical event_type: episode_completion_status (with status: success/failure)
- Closes the global content ledger (media_idempotence): every ingestion path
  publishes here when it finishes, so this is the one place that knows a
  media_key is no longer in flight and can move it to processed/failed. Without
  that write the ledger stays at ``reserved`` and every later save of the same
  URL is parked in ``pending`` for ever (task-390).
- For each media key, fetches watchers and marks their processing state
- Announces the readable media to every user who saved it, with one push
  notification each (task-405): a processing that finishes while the app is closed
  has no other way to reach the person who asked for it. Success only — a failure
  returns early below, and a save that could not be processed is news the user
  finds in the app, not an interruption. Email notifications stay disabled.

Search indexing (Algolia) is decoupled from the watcher loop:
- The submitting user (resolved from the event's canonical_job_id) is ALWAYS indexed,
  regardless of whether watchers exist.
- Each watcher is also indexed (for cross-user dedup scenarios).
- Deduplication: a user_id is only indexed once per event, even if they appear both as
  the canonical submitter and as a watcher.
