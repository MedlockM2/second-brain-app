"""
The back half of the library lifecycle: purge cascade + daily reconciliation.

One Lambda, two triggers, because both answer the same question ("did the
deletion actually delete everything?") and neither is worth its own function:

1. **``user_media`` DynamoDB stream, REMOVE events.** When the TTL sweeps a row a
   user soft-deleted 30 days earlier (see
   ``core/services/media_deletion_service.py``), the cascade removes the search
   record for that save. Content-scoped artifacts and job objects are removed
   only after no retained save row still references the same ``media_key``.

2. **A daily schedule.** The reconciliation of §6.5: artifacts whose library row
   is gone, rows whose ``purge_at`` passed without the cascade running, dangling
   ``last_job_id`` pointers, per-user library size. This is the outcome metric the
   task-218 incident was missing — the archiver Lambda reported zero errors for
   two months while the data it was supposed to protect disappeared.

Which REMOVEs are cascaded, and which are deliberately not:

    TTL sweep, ``deleted_at`` present    -> cascade. The expected path.
    TTL sweep, no ``deleted_at``         -> ALARM, no cascade. Nothing but the
                                            deletion use case may write
                                            ``purge_at`` (invariant I2), so this
                                            means an illegal writer exists. The
                                            row is already gone; refusing to
                                            cascade keeps the artifacts and the
                                            objects recoverable while the
                                            regression is fixed.
    Deletion by a caller                 -> no cascade. Account deletion
                                            (task-224) cascades inline, over the
                                            whole account at once, which is the
                                            correct scope for shared objects. A
                                            second cascade here would be a
                                            duplicate at best.

    still stored, and still held an entry in the sparse index, forever. Past the

    in so many words not to add a second one. A TTL would also destroy the whole
    library row rather than one attribute -- the wrong granularity entirely, since
    the row must survive and only the stamp goes. So the purge is a targeted
    ``UpdateItem``, issued from the pass that already scans the table.

    The write is conditional on the stamp still being older than the cutoff, so
    an engagement recorded between the scan and this write is never erased. The
    comparison is lexicographic on the ISO-8601 string, the same one
    ``stamp_engagement`` and the ``engaged-index`` range condition already make:
    every stamp is written as a UTC ``isoformat()``, so the two orders agree.
