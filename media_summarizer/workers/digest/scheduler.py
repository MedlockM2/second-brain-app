"""Digest scheduler: the producer of Digest push notifications.

Invoked by EventBridge on a fixed UTC grid (see
``infrastructure/terraform/modules/platform/lambda_digest_scheduler.tf``) and,
on every tick, answers one question per account: *is a Digest period due for
this person right now, in their own zone?*

**Why a sweep and not a per-user schedule.** The daily Digest goes out at 18:30
and the weekly one on Monday at 09:30 — both in the *user's* local time, so
there is no single UTC instant to fire at. One EventBridge schedule per account
does not scale and one Lambda per zone is 400-odd rules to maintain. Instead a
single tick runs often enough that every local send instant falls inside one of
its passes, and the tick itself decides who is due. Task-368's benchmark
measured that across the 498 zones of the IANA database, 18:30 local and Monday
09:30 local only ever land on UTC minutes :00, :30 and :45 — the grid is chosen
to cover them with room to spare.

**Dueness is a grace window, not an equality.** A period is due when its send
instant is behind us by less than ``SEND_GRACE`` and nothing has been announced
for it yet. Matching the minute exactly would be tighter but brittle in both
directions: a tick that fails and is retried a minute late would drop the
notification entirely, and a future zone at an offset the grid does not cover
would go permanently silent. With a grace window, the worst case is a
notification a few minutes late.

**One notification per period per account, whatever the sweep does.** The
guarantee does not come from this module's control flow — 72 passes a day, plus
Lambda retries, make that unprovable. It comes from
``digest_db.mark_digest_published``, a conditional write on ``published_at``
that exactly one caller can win. The message is enqueued only by that winner.

**Three ways an account produces nothing**, all silent and all normal: the
period holds no media (nothing was captured, so there is nothing to announce and
no row is even written), the account has never reported an IANA zone (guessing
when to interrupt someone is worse than not interrupting them, and the app
reports its zone on every foreground pass so the state is short-lived), or the
settings say no.

Usage (a single tick, same as the Lambda does):
