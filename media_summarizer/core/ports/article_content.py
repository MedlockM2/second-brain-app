"""
Port (interface) for reading a web article's text.

The contract any article reader must implement. Two callers use it, which is the
whole point of it being a port:

- `core/media_ingestion/adapters/resolvers.py::ArticleResolver`, on the API path,
  **before** the content identity is settled -- an article whose text changed is a
  different media, so the text has to be in hand before `media_key` exists
  (task-392);
- `workers/article_extraction_worker.py`, for the items an RSS subscription
  produces, which arrive with their job already created.

One implementation, in `infrastructure/resolvers/trafilatura_article_resolver.py`.
Failures are named by `ArticleFetchErrorCode` and each one maps to the
`MediaFailureCode` the mobile app already renders in the reader's language: this
port adds no new user-facing vocabulary.
