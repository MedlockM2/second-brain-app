"""
Full-account erasure: the one place that deletes everything an account owns.

Why this module exists
----------------------
App Store guideline 5.1.1(v) requires any app that lets a user create an account
to let them delete it from inside the app, and GDPR art. 17 requires that
deletion to actually erase the data instead of hiding it. The route this replaces
(``DELETE /api/users/{user_id}``) did neither: it removed a single row from
``users`` and left the library, the artifacts, the S3 objects and the search
index behind -- an account that could no longer log in while its content stayed
fully indexed. That is the worst of both worlds and is exactly the state the
ordering below is designed to make impossible.

Ordering is a correctness property, not a style choice
------------------------------------------------------
Steps run from the most *discoverable* data to the least, and the identity rows
(``auth_tokens``, then the ``users`` row) go last:

    search index -> artifacts + their objects -> media objects -> media rows
    -> per-user tables -> identity

A failure therefore leaves an account that still authenticates and can retry the
deletion, never an account that is locked out while its transcripts are still
searchable. Every step is query-then-delete against DynamoDB, so a re-run after a
partial failure is a no-op on whatever already went (AC#6).

Content shared between accounts
-------------------------------
The per-content cascade — artifact rows, their S3 objects and the objects a
processing job wrote — lives in ``core/services/media_purge_service.py`` and is
shared with the ``user_media`` TTL purge (task-243). Media-scoped artifacts are
addressed by ``media_key`` within the user, while each library row remains an
independent save.

Deliberately out of scope
-------------------------
``media_idempotence`` (PK ``media_key``) and ``feed_forecasts`` (PK ``feed_id``)
describe content, not people: they carry no user id, are shared by every account
that submitted the same media, and cannot be queried per user in the first place.
Artifact rows are reached through the scope index, keyed on ``user_id``.
``pricing_config`` is global configuration.

The archive bucket is not swept either: its keys are partitioned by archive date,
not by user, so there is nothing to enumerate. Instead each job row is stamped
with ``purge_reason = account_deletion`` before it is deleted, which is the signal
the DynamoDB-stream archiver (task-242, a no-op placeholder today) needs to skip
the REMOVE events this purge generates. Without it, erasing an account would
*create* a copy of its data in the archive bucket.
