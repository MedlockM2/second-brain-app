"""
Pricing configuration service with in-memory cache (TTL ~5 minutes).

Reads all pricing/quota parameters from DynamoDB pricing_config table.
On first load, seeds default values derived from the validated consumption model
(docs/research/task-287-consumption-model/README.md, owner_decision: ok).

The service is stateless-safe: multiple processes will each maintain their own
cache but share the same DynamoDB source of truth. Changes propagate within
the TTL window (300 seconds by default).

# One unit is metered: the *minute*. A minute is a minute of media we pay a
# transcription provider to process, and everything that is not transcription is
# unlimited. Ingestion paths that trigger no per-item provider fee (articles, web
# pages, TikTok, single-item AI generations) cost zero minutes by design — see
# §3.1 of the benchmark for the conversion table. An Instagram photo post is no
# longer one of them since task-384: its images go through the document parser we
# pay for, so they are billed at `document_pages_per_minute` like any page.
#
# These are seeded into DynamoDB if the table is empty on first read.
