"""
Durable library persistence — the use-case layer of task-240/220.

Every user save goes through :func:`save_media_for_user`, which creates or reuses
exactly one ``user_media`` row. This is the write half of Option A
(``docs/research/task-218-durable-media-library-persistence/README.md`` §4.3).

Since task-220 (Phase 3) the API *reads* this table too, which changed the
failure contract of the save path: a save whose durable row is missing is a save
the user cannot see, so it now fails the request instead of being swallowed. The
Phase-1 ``try_save_media_for_user`` wrapper that absorbed those failures is gone.

Failure policy, straight from §6.5 and from the incident that motivated the whole
benchmark:

- The **save path** (:func:`save_media_for_user`) logs ``durable_media.write_failed``
  at ERROR and re-raises. That event is alarmed
  (``infrastructure/terraform/modules/platform/durable_media_alerts.tf``). A
  durable write that fails silently is precisely how a library loses rows for two
  months without anyone noticing, so it is never swallowed here.
- The **mirror path** (:func:`mirror_job`) logs the same alarmed event but does
  not raise. It only refreshes a denormalised snapshot; failing the pipeline over
  a status hint would trade a cosmetic staleness for a real processing failure.
  The caller decides which contract applies.
