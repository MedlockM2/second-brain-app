"""
Media identity helpers.

This module defines the canonical URL normalization policy and the deterministic
media key generation used for cross-media idempotence.

It also owns the **source type** of a URL (`MediaSourceType`,
`classify_source_type`): the single place that decides what kind of thing a link
points at. Both the canonicalization below and the ingestion classifier
(`core/media_ingestion/adapters/classifiers.py`) read that one answer, because
two host tables deciding the same question is how they come to disagree.

`WEB_ARTICLE` is a *recognised* type with its own criterion, not the leftover of
a chain of per-domain branches (task-392): whether a URL is an article decides
whether its text is fetched before its identity is settled, so it cannot be a
classification default.
