"""
Artifact generation: scope resolution, reuse of what already exists, storage.

Both scopes go through one mechanism (task-269 decision, strategy S1): a media
artifact is a folder artifact whose ``sources`` has one element. A request
resolves the scope's sources, checks the ceilings, writes **one immutable history
entry** and enqueues **one** SQS message per artifact type.

One rule decides whether anything is generated at all (task-316 owner decision):
**an existing artifact is reused as soon as the set of sources behind it is
identical, and a generation only happens when that set differs.** The
``artifact_id`` is a hash of (user, scope, scope_id, type, parameters, sorted
source ids) with no time component, so finding the artifact that already answers a
request is a single ``GetItem`` with no time bound and no lock table. A media item
has exactly one source and that set never changes, so "one generation per type
per media" follows from the same rule with no special case; a folder can
legitimately produce a new entry, and only once its sources have changed.

The history stays append-only: a different source set writes a new entry next to
the older ones, and nothing is ever overwritten or invalidated. The single
exception is an entry that *failed* — it holds no artifact to reuse, so a request
for the same key reclaims it and generates again rather than being barred forever
by one transient provider error.
