"""The engagement signal behind the Inbox "Continue learning" row (task-303).

Owner-validated recommendation of
``docs/research/task-303-engagement-recency-model/README.md`` — Option A: the
signal is **one attribute on the thing itself**, ``last_engaged_at``, plus one
sparse GSI on ``user_media``. No activity table, no event log, no device-local
store, and therefore nothing that can hold a pointer to destroyed content.

What counts as an engagement (§2.2), and nothing else:

    E1  a generation was launched -- ``POST /api/artifacts`` accepted a request for
        this scope, including the ``200`` paths that hand back an artifact which
        already existed. The user asked; that the answer was already generated is
        an implementation detail they never see.
    E2  an artifact was opened and rendered -- the viewer reports it once per
        mount, through ``POST /api/engagements``.

Opening a media detail screen does **not** count: it would make the row a
*recently tapped* list, duplicate "Recently added", fire on accidental taps, and
admit items that have nothing to continue. Reading the transcript does not count
in v1 either, because the reader is the detail screen's default tab and the app
cannot tell the two events apart.

Both writes are best-effort in the ``quota_enforcer._debit`` sense: they swallow,
they log, and they never fail the action the user actually asked for. There is no
retry -- the event recurs the next time the user opens something, and a retry queue
for a decoration is disproportionate.
