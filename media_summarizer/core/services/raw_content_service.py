"""
Service for retrieving and formatting raw content from media items.

Raw content is the source material (transcript, extracted text, OCR result)
stored in S3 under the processing job's transcription_s3_key.
This service downloads that content and formats it into readable text.

Variant selection (task-419):
- The reader can ask for the source text of a translated media instead of its
  translation (``variant="original"``). The translated object's S3 key is derived
  deterministically from the original's, so the original never stops being
  reachable from ``job.transcription_s3_key``: this is a choice of body in the
  response, not a second store.

Translation architecture (task-200, task-414):
- /raw-content NEVER calls LLM translation synchronously.
- The translation into the reading language of every account that saved the
  media is already armed at ingestion (``ingestion_translation_service``), so on
  first open it is usually done or in flight -- this path then only reads state.
- If a cached translation exists in S3, it is returned immediately.
- If not, the original transcript is returned with translation_pending=true
  and, when nobody armed it yet (a reading language changed after ingestion, a
  reader whose save was not part of the ingestion), an async job is dispatched
  via SQS to the transcript-translation-worker. Same atomic reservation as the
  ingestion hook, so the two triggers never enqueue the same couple twice.
- The mobile client polls /raw-content until the translation is ready.

Formatting architecture (task-232, benchmark task-231 option B):
- Producers already store paragraph-delimited plain text.
- This service re-runs the same shared normalizer at read time. It is
  idempotent, so new content passes through untouched while transcripts ingested
  before the change get structured on the fly — no S3 migration needed.

    Retrieve and format the raw content for a media item.

    documents), so the former ``deepgram_json`` / ``whisper_json`` /
    ``json_transcript`` branches were unreachable and have been removed
    (task-231 section 12).
