"""
Resume — or end — the artifact requests that were waiting for their sources.

A generation asked for while a source was still being transcribed is not refused:
it is written as a ``queued`` entry carrying ``awaiting_expires_at`` and nothing
is enqueued (see ``artifact_service.plan_artifact_generation``). This module is
the other half — what turns that entry into a real generation once the text
lands, and what ends it when the text will never come (task-360).

Transcription is the only preparation an artifact ever waits on. A source in a
foreign language is not a wait: the generation reads the original transcript and
asks the model for the reading language (task-398).

So it hangs off the one completion event the pipeline already emits, and adds no
queue, no schedule and no index of its own:
``workers/events/media_completed_worker`` — an ingestion finished, or failed.

It names a ``media_key``, so the lookup goes the same way every time: the saves
of that content (cross-user, since ingestion is deduplicated globally), then the
scopes those saves belong to — the media itself, its folder, and that
folder's ancestors, because a folder artifact covers every descendant —
then the ``queued`` entries of those scopes. An entry is waiting on *this* media
when its own snapshot says so: a source line carrying ``preparation``. Nothing
else has to be indexed, and an entry that had already excluded this media before
the request is never mistaken for one waiting on it.

Exactly-once is the conditional write in ``claim_awaiting_artifact``: the end of
an ingestion and the last two sources of a folder landing together both reach
here, and only the caller that clears ``awaiting_expires_at`` sends the message.
