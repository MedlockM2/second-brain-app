"""
Consumption enforcement for the validated V1 model.

One unit is metered: the **minute**. A minute is a minute of media we pay a
transcription provider to process, plus the three flat conversions of the model
(a bought caption set counts 1, five document pages count 1, five sources of a
folder generation count 1). Everything that is not transcription — articles,
web pages, TikToks, single-item AI generations — is unlimited and debits nothing.
An Instagram photo post left that free list in task-384: its slides are read by
the paid document parser, so they debit at the document rate through
:func:`record_document_parse`, exactly like the pages of an upload.

The rule that keeps the accounting honest: **the meter follows the provider call,
not the URL**. An API endpoint only ever *checks*; the debit happens at the place
that spends provider money (the Deepgram gate, the paid caption fetch, the
document parse, the folder generation). That is what makes "the same import
charged twice" and "a transcription nobody charged" unrepresentable rather than
merely fixed.

Three layers protect the margin (see docs/research/task-287-consumption-model):
1. the visible allowance itself — minutes x 0.00664 EUR is always a fraction of
   the tier's net revenue, so no per-user euro ceiling is needed;
2. invisible daily burst guards, which never refuse anything and only tell the
   owner an account is worth a look;
3. the shared provider pools, in `provider_pool_guard` — Apify credit and
   LlamaParse credits are platform-wide and no per-user allowance can protect them.

One temporary regime sits on top of all of it: while `beta_access` is open
(task-429) every account is served the widest allowance the catalogue holds,
because nothing is purchasable before the stores. It raises the allowance and
nothing else — the counters, the debits and the burst guards are untouched, since
what the testers really consume is what the next pricing model will be built on.
Both the block and every line reading it are deleted when the beta ends.

    """A subscriber's allowance: `max(trial, paid)` while the trial window is open.

    Buying a plan must never take anything away, so as long as the free trial is
    still running each figure is the larger of the paid tier's and the trial's,
    compared independently. What the user bought is unaffected — `tier`,
    `subscription_tier` and `subscription_status` keep describing the plan, because
    they did buy it; only the figures move.

    **The allowance drops when the window closes.** From the trial's end date the
    paid tier stands alone, so a plan below the trial loses everything the trial was
    adding. That is the decision's intended consequence, not a defect, which is why
    the instant comes back with the figures: the app needs it to announce the drop
    in advance instead of looking broken on the day.

    One consequence of keeping the counter on the subscription's period — which this
    function deliberately does not touch, so that no second helping of minutes is
    handed out mid-window — is that inside the window the subscriber gets the trial's
    allowance **per subscription period rather than once**. Bounded by the length of
    the trial, and in the user's favour.

    The trial window costs a user-row read, and it is only paid for when it can
    change something: both pairs of figures come from the pricing config, already in
    memory, so a plan that already covers the trial on both axes is settled without
    any `GetItem`. Which plans those are is whatever the config says at read time.

    Returns `(allowance, trial_end)`, `trial_end` being None whenever the trial is
    not what raises the figures.

    The billing period is never the calendar month: it is the window the user's

    `period_end` the app shows and nothing rolls over. For a subscription that is
    its renewal window, emptying on the anniversary; for a free trial it is the
    single window that opens at the account's creation and closes
    `free_trial.duration_days` later, so one trial grants one allowance and
    crossing a month boundary refills nothing.

    A running trial is not cancelled by buying a plan: for a subscriber the
    allowance is `max(trial, paid)` until the window closes — see
    `_subscriber_allowance`, which holds that rule — while the period, the tier and
    the status stay the subscription's.
