"""Re-host a media cover into our own bucket (task-304).

Applies the owner's decision at the end of task-302 (**Approach C**): a cover is
hotlinked when its CDN URL is unsigned and stable, and re-hosted only when the
URL is *signed and expiring* -- Instagram (``oh``/``oe``) and TikTok
(``x-expires``), which answer 403 within hours to days -- or when the image is
the user's own private file (a camera capture or a gallery pick, up to 50 MB).

Everything here is best-effort by contract. A cover is a display detail: a
timeout, a 404, an unreadable payload or a missing bucket must degrade to "this
tile shows its media-type icon", never to a failed ingestion. Every entry point
therefore returns ``None`` instead of raising, and logs the reason.

The stored object is a downscaled JPEG bounded by ``COVER_MAX_EDGE`` on both
sides, so a 16:9 thumbnail becomes 640x360 and a 9:16 reel cover becomes
360x640. The crop to the tile's ratio is the client's job (``contentFit:
"cover"``), which keeps this side free of any layout decision.

**One exception, and only one: a rendered document page** (``capture_document_page``,
task-344). That principle was written for a cover that already exists with
someone else's framing -- a re-hosted Instagram thumbnail, a user's photo --
where cropping destroys information we did not create. A page render has no
pre-existing framing: we choose the raster region, so choosing it *is* the
render, and the owner's decision on task-343 §6.2 is to choose the **top** 16:9
band server-side. The stored derivative is then exactly ``COVER_TILE_WIDTH`` x
``COVER_TILE_HEIGHT``, which makes the clients' ``contentFit="cover"`` an exact
fit: every component that renders a cover inherits the framing, including the
next one somebody writes.
