"""
Media search service: metadata-based search and filtering for user media items.

Provides text search on title (case-insensitive substring match), filtering by
folder (including subfolders), source platform, and media type.
Results are sorted by saved_at, newest first by default, with cursor-based
pagination. A caller can ask for oldest first instead (``sort_direction="asc"``,
task-323): a triage pass works through the backlog in the order it accumulated,
so it needs the tail of the library, and reversing a page client-side would only
reverse *that page* — the oldest item would still be on the last page.

Source of truth is the durable ``user_media`` table, never ``processing_jobs``
(task-220, §4.4 of the task-218 benchmark). This is what makes the library and
Search survive the expiry of a processing job: nothing on this path dereferences
an operational row, so there is nothing to lose when one disappears.
