        for a queue to do: either the text is here and this stores it, or the page
        could not be read and this records why.

        A failure records itself and stops there. It used to matter enormously
        whether the cause was transient, because a `failed` ledger row under the
        URL-derived key answered every later save of that URL with the same
        failure: a transient cause therefore had to *delete* the reservation to
        avoid freezing the link. Since task-399 a `failed` row owns nothing and the
        next submission writes over it, so both causes take the same path -- and
        the failure event is published either way, which is what ends the artifact
        waits and the watchers that a released reservation used to leave hanging.
