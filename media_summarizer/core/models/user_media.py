"""
Durable canonical record of a media item saved by a user.

THE source of truth for "what is in my library". Introduced by task-240 per the
owner-validated Option A of
``docs/research/task-218-durable-media-library-persistence/README.md`` (§4.1-4.3).

How it relates to the other stores:

    user_media          durable, user-owned. Never expires unless the user
                        deletes the item. Answers "what did I save, how is it
                        organized, is it ready".
    processing_jobs     purely operational and expirable. Answers "what is the
                        pipeline doing right now". Its disappearance must be
                        invisible to the library.
    media_artifacts     user-owned generated content, scoped by media_key.
    media_idempotence   global per-content processing ledger, keyed by media_key.

Identity
--------
``media_item_id`` identifies one user save, while ``media_key`` identifies the
content globally. Saving the same content twice therefore creates two opaque
``mi_`` ids that may carry different folders while both point at the same
transcript and artifact history.

Nullability
-----------
``processing_status`` and ``last_job_id`` are ``None`` by default and stay
optional forever (invariant I3). They are denormalised operational hints: the
library must render fully without them, and ``last_job_id`` is explicitly allowed
to point at a job that no longer exists.
