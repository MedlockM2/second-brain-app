"""
Canonical internal model for AI artifacts.

One record type serves both scopes (task-269/270): a media artifact is a
folder artifact with a single source. The record is an **append-only history
entry** — once it reaches ``ready`` it is never modified again. There is no
staleness flag, no expiry, no automatic regeneration.

An entry is also the permanent answer for its source set: ``artifact_id`` is
derived from the sources, so asking again for the same type over the same set
returns this very record instead of generating a second one. A media therefore
gets one artifact per type and per ``parameters`` — its source set never changes.
A folder gets a new entry only when its contents changed, which is why the
gap between an entry's ``sources`` snapshot and the folder's current contents
*is* the history rather than a defect to repair.
