"""
DynamoDB access layer for the durable ``user_media`` library table (task-240).

Schema (USER_MEDIA_TABLE, ``user_media-<env>``):
- PK: user_id (S)
- SK: media_item_id (S)
- LSI saved-at-index: saved_at (S)
- LSI folder-index:   folder_sort_key (S) == "<folder_id>#<saved_at>"
- GSI media-key-index: media_key (S), media_item_id (S)
- GSI engaged-index:  user_id (S), last_engaged_at (S) -- sparse (task-303)
- TTL: purge_at (N) -- user-initiated deletion ONLY

This module is the ONLY place allowed to write the table. Two invariants from
§2.2 of the task-218 benchmark are enforced here structurally rather than by
convention, because both were violated in the incident this table exists to fix:

  I1  ``create`` holds the module's only ``put_item``. Every other
      mutation is an attribute-level ``update_item``, so a metadata refresh can
      never overwrite the folder a user set from another device.

  I2  ``purge_at`` and ``deleted_at`` are rejected by the generic update helper.
      Exactly two functions in the codebase touch them, both here (task-243, §6.2),
      which is what ``scripts/check_purge_at_writers.py`` enforces in CI:
      :func:`mark_deleted` sets them, reachable only from the user-initiated
      deletion use case (``core/services/media_deletion_service.py``). Account
      deletion (task-224) is a different use case and uses
      ``delete_all_for_user``, which removes the rows outright instead of
      scheduling them -- an erasure request is not a soft delete.

The engagement signal behind the Inbox "Continue learning" row (task-303) is an
*attribute of this row*, ``last_engaged_at``, and that is the property the design
was chosen for: deleting the media deletes the signal, in the same write. Nothing
about it is added to the purge cascade, to :func:`delete_all_for_user` or to the
account-deletion inventory, and there is no separate store that could keep a
pointer to destroyed content. A row that is soft-deleted but not yet swept keeps
its attribute for the length of its grace period, so the read path
(:func:`list_recently_engaged`) drops it on ``attribute_not_exists(deleted_at)``.

Table name resolution is lazy on purpose. ``required_env`` raises when the
variable is missing, and this module is imported by the API save path; resolving
at import time would turn a local script that never touches the library into an
import crash.
