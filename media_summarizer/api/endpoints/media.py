"""
Media API endpoints.

Provides operations on media items (processing jobs from the user's perspective).
Supports URL ingestion, file upload (document parsing), status retrieval, and folder assignment via PATCH.

Upload: presigned PUT URL — binary never transits through this API. API Gateway
base64-encodes the request body into the Lambda event, so Lambda's 6 MiB
synchronous payload ceiling caps any HTTP body at 4 718 592 raw bytes; above that
the gateway answers `Request Entity Too Large` itself, before the request reaches
FastAPI, which made the 50 MB / 25 MB limits this module advertises unreachable.
Clients therefore ask `POST /api/media/upload-url` for a presigned PUT, send the
bytes straight to S3, and hand the resulting key to the ingestion endpoint. Same
pattern as `endpoints/bug_reports.py`.

    This API never sees the body -- the client PUTs it straight to S3 -- so the

    the point:

    1. **The ETag**, when it really is the MD5 of the body. That holds for a
       single-part PUT of an object S3 kept in the clear or under SSE-S3, which is
       what every upload here is: a presigned URL authorizes ``PutObject`` and
       nothing else, and both staging buckets pin SSE-S3
       (``infrastructure/terraform/modules/platform/s3.tf``). Preferred because it
       is the strongest digest S3 offers here and is identical for identical bytes
       whatever the client did or did not send.
    2. **An additional checksum**, when it covers the whole object. Taken on the
       plaintext, so it stays a content identity under any encryption mode, and
       present even when nobody asked: S3 computes a full-object CRC64NVME by
       itself. This is what carries the two cases where the ETag stops being the
       body's MD5.

    Everything else is refused rather than assumed away (task-393). A digest
    computed part by part -- the ``"<hex>-<n>"`` shape, or ``ChecksumType``
    ``COMPOSITE`` -- is a function of how the transfer was split, not of the
    content; an ETag under SSE-KMS/DSSE-KMS/SSE-C is a digest of the ciphertext.
    Returning such a value would silently reintroduce the defect this replaced --
    a key that does not identify the content -- so the caller turns the failure
