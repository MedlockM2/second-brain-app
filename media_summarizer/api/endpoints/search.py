"""
Search API endpoints for transcript search.

Provides full-text search over indexed media transcripts, proxied through the
backend to Algolia.

Multi-tenant isolation: the shared index stores all users' records with a
``user_id`` attribute, and isolation is enforced by an explicit user_id filter
applied server-side in the query.

    Everything about how the hit *looks*, and everything the client's actions

    are called, where they are filed or when they were saved. That is what makes
    one media show the same cover, the same subtitle and the same date whether it
    is reached through the library list or through a search.

    ``in_library`` is the one field that says which source answered. A deletion
    *does* drop the item's chunks from the index, and does it there and then
    (``media_deletion_service``), because Algolia is a live read surface: a
    deleted media stops answering searches immediately. That removal is
    best-effort though — it is retried by the purge cascade 30 days later — so a
    hit can still come back with no row behind it while the two surfaces
    disagree. It then carries only what the index knows, and there is nothing
    left to rename, move or delete.
