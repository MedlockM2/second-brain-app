# Canonical Media API Contract (Frozen)

Frozen on February 24, 2026 for task-19.

This document is the contract baseline for:
- backend implementation tasks (`task-10`, `task-20`, `task-21`, `task-22`, `task-33`)
- mobile/web client implementation tasks (`task-39`, `task-7`)

Pre-production policy for this roadmap:
- canonical API paths are unversioned
- no runtime fallback to legacy podcast-specific contracts in target state

## Scope

This freeze defines:
- canonical request/response contracts for ingestion, status, artifact creation, and artifact reads
- domain types and statuses for `MediaItem`, `MediaArtifact`, and processing lifecycle usage
- stable error payload and error code catalog for client handling

## Source of truth in code

Backend contract models:
- `media_summarizer/api/models/media_contracts.py`

Frontend contract types:
- `front/src/types/media.ts`

## Runtime implementation status

`task-10` implements the canonical ingestion entrypoint:
- `POST /api/media/ingest-url` in `media_summarizer/api/endpoints/media.py`
- authenticated with the same bearer auth context used by existing API endpoints
- wired to the hexagonal ingestion core (`build_default_ingest_url_use_case`)

Operational behavior now implemented in runtime:
- deterministic URL normalization via canonical media identity derivation
- every successful save gets a fresh opaque `media_item_id`, even when the same user
  saves an equivalent URL several times
- processing and transcription are globally deduplicated by canonical `media_key`;
  equivalent links share the content job without sharing a library row
- response returns both `media_item_id` and `processing_job.job_id` for client tracking
- invalid/unsupported URL errors are explicit and stable (`INVALID_URL`, `UNSUPPORTED_URL`)

`task-22` implements the canonical media status read entrypoint:
- `GET /api/media/{media_item_id}` in `media_summarizer/api/endpoints/media.py`
- authenticated with ownership checks against the current user

Operational behavior now implemented in runtime:
- status response is built from current `ProcessingJob` state with canonical lifecycle mapping
- terminal state details are surfaced through `processing_job.completed_at` and `error_code`; there is
  no `error_message` — see "Ingestion failure contract" below
- stable not-found and unauthorized errors are returned as `MEDIA_NOT_FOUND` (404) and `NOT_AUTHORIZED` (403)
- the media status response carries **no** artifact projection (task-270): artifacts are a per-scope, append-only history, so "the artifact of this type" no longer exists as a concept
- transcript metadata (`language`, `segments_count`, `duration_seconds`) is surfaced when the runtime has persisted it from transcription or article extraction

`task-270` makes artifact generation **scope-addressed** and its storage **append-only**:
- one set of routes under `/api/artifacts` serves a single media (`scope="media"`) and a folder (`scope="folder"`); the per-media routes are gone, with no alias
- a folder-scoped artifact covers the folder **and all its descendants**, exactly like `GET /api/media?folder_id=`
- every generation writes a **new immutable entry** carrying a snapshot of the sources it read; nothing is overwritten, nothing is invalidated, and adding or removing a media from a folder changes no existing entry
- an existing entry is reused **permanently** (task-322): the `artifact_id` is a hash of (user, scope, scope_id, type, parameters, sorted source ids) with no time component, so a request whose source set already produced an artifact returns that artifact, whatever the delay, without a second generation and without debiting quota. A media therefore gets one artifact per type and per `parameters`; a folder regenerates only when its contents changed. The generator version is recorded on the entry but excluded from the key, so bumping a prompt does not reopen a right to regenerate
- ownership is checked by comparing the entry's `user_id`, not by resolving a media item — a folder artifact has none
- a media-scoped request still accepts a user-owned `media_item_id`, but storage and
  history use `(user_id, media_key)` internally, so the same user's saves of one
  content item share their artifact history
- ceilings are 25 sources and 120 000 estimated tokens; beyond them the API refuses and never truncates

`task-23` purges legacy ingestion/completion compatibility from active canonical paths:
- canonical runtime idempotence/watchers use `media_key` only (no legacy episode-guid fallback reads/writes)
- worker completion events and fan-out finalization rely on `media_key`/`canonical_job_id` identity only
- legacy episode-guid table/env references are removed from canonical runtime config and migration docs

## Canonical endpoints

1. `POST /api/media/ingest-url`
2. `GET /api/media/{media_item_id}`
3. `POST /api/artifacts`
4. `GET /api/artifacts?scope=&scope_id=`
5. `GET /api/artifacts/{artifact_id}`
6. `GET /api/artifacts/{artifact_id}/content`
7. `DELETE /api/media/{media_item_id}`
8. `PATCH /api/media/{media_id}`

Authentication:
- all endpoints require authenticated user context

## Request and response contracts

### 1) POST /api/media/ingest-url

Request (`IngestUrlRequest`):
```json
{
  "url": "https://open.spotify.com/episode/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6",
  "source_app": "android.share_sheet",
  "locale": "fr-FR",
  "transcript_language": "fr",
  "idempotency_key": "mobile-share-4b7e8d",
  "folder_id": "folder_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7"
}
```

`transcript_language` and `folder_id` are optional. When `folder_id` is omitted or `null`,
the backend assigns the user's default Uncategorized folder. A provided folder id
must belong to the authenticated user.

`transcript_language` is a **per-submission override**. When omitted, the backend defaults to the
authenticated user's `reading_language` preference (set during onboarding, editable in Settings via
`PATCH /api/auth/me`). Clients should therefore send it only when the user explicitly wants a
different language for this one item (e.g. keeping an English video's original transcript while
their reading language is French). The value is normalized to a bare lowercase ISO 639-1 code
(`"fr-FR"` → `"fr"`) and travels to the ingestion worker, which asks the transcript provider for
that language. If the video has no captions in that language, the provider returns its default
track, and the reader's full-text translation brings it back to the user's
`reading_language` when they open it (`GET /api/media/{id}/raw-content`).

Response (`IngestUrlResponse`):
```json

    "updated_at": "2026-02-24T20:20:00Z"
  },
  "deduplicated": false
}
```

### 2) GET /api/media/{media_item_id}

Response (`MediaStatusResponse`):
```json
{
  "media_item": {
    "media_item_id": "med_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7",

    "created_at": "2026-02-24T20:20:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-02-24T20:37:10Z"
  },
  "processing_job": {
    "job_id": "job_01JQ8X8J5T9Q5V7Q4TW4N1HY03",
    "status": "ready_for_artifacts",
    "progress": {
      "percentage": 100,
      "stage": "ready_for_artifacts"
    },
    "created_at": "2026-02-24T20:20:00Z",

    "completed_at": "2026-02-24T20:35:30Z"
  }
}
```

`media_item.title` is the `title` attribute of the durable `user_media` row, i.e. the exact value
`GET /api/media` returns for the same item — the detail header and the list vignette read one field,
not two. It is nullable (a row whose metadata has not resolved yet has none); clients degrade to the
source URL, never to a URL path segment, which used to surface raw provider ids such as a Spotify
episode id as a title.

#### Ingestion failure contract

A job that failed carries a **code**, and only a code:

```json
{
  "processing_job": {
    "job_id": "job_01JQ8X8J5T9Q5V7Q4TW4N1HY03",
    "status": "failed",
    "progress": { "percentage": 0, "stage": "failed" },
    "created_at": "2026-02-24T20:20:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-02-24T20:21:12Z",
    "started_at": "2026-02-24T20:20:04Z",
    "completed_at": null,
    "error_code": "NO_TRANSCRIBABLE_MEDIA"
  }
}
```

There is **no `error_message`** on this response, and there never will be: the
sentence the reader sees is built on the device from `error_code`, in the reader's
language, by `mobile/src/lib/getFriendlyErrorMessage.ts`. That is RFC 9457's split
between `type` (stable, part of the contract) and `title`/`detail` (negotiated,
never depended upon), and AIP-193's rule that a `message` is developer-facing
English. Sending English prose here is what put "Unable to extract transcribable
media from this Instagram URL." on an `fr-FR` screen (task-359).

The vocabulary is `MediaFailureCode` in
`media_summarizer/core/models/failure_codes.py` — the source of truth, whose
docstring states the rules for adding a member. As of task-384:

| Group | Codes |
|---|---|
| The source cannot yield what we need | `MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE`, `GEO_RESTRICTED`, `AGE_RESTRICTED`, `LIVE_CONTENT_UNSUPPORTED`, `NO_TRANSCRIBABLE_MEDIA`, `NO_TRANSCRIPT_AVAILABLE`, `POST_TEXT_EMPTY`, `NOT_AN_ARTICLE_PAGE`, `ARTICLE_TEXT_NOT_FOUND`, `DOCUMENT_PARSE_FAILED` |
| The extraction chain is at fault | `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `PROVIDER_RESULT_INVALID`, `PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITED`, `PROVIDER_TIMED_OUT` |
| Our configuration or budget | `PROVIDER_AUTH_FAILED`, `PROVIDER_CREDITS_DEPLETED`, `PROVIDER_CONFIG_ERROR` |
| The user's allowance | `OUT_OF_MINUTES`, `ITEM_TOO_LONG` |
| Ours, and only ours | `INVALID_JOB_MESSAGE`, `SUBMISSION_FAILED`, `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` |

`error_code` is typed as the enum, so a value outside it cannot be serialized; a
row whose stored code is unknown to the current build is served as `null`, and the
app degrades to its generic failure line rather than showing anything raw.

Everything *variable* about a failure — an HTTP status, a provider name, an Apify
run id, a duration, a content type — lives in `ProcessingJob.error_metadata`
alongside a stable lower-snake `reason` token. That attribute is **diagnostic and
not part of this contract**: it is served only by the operational
`GET /jobs/{job_id}` router and is absent from every library response. The
provider's own wording is never persisted; it reaches CloudWatch through
`exc_info` on the worker's terminal log event.

### 3) POST /api/artifacts

Request:
```json
{
  "scope": "folder",
  "scope_id": "c4ef2e55-8449-4a71-be46-bcf1a6eeca3e",
  "artifact_type": "summary_detailed",
  "parameters": {
    "language": "fr"
  }
}
```

`202` when a generation was queued, `200` when the response is an entry that
already existed. Response is the shape of `GET /api/artifacts/{artifact_id}` plus
`generation_outcome`, which names the four cases the caller must be able to tell
apart:

| `generation_outcome` | Status | Meaning | Quota |
|---|---|---|---|
| `created` | `202` | First request for this source set: entry written and queued | debited |
| `retried` | `202` | The entry for this key had `failed`, so it is reclaimed and queued again | debited (idempotent on `artifact_id`, so a retry of the same id charges nothing extra) |
| `reused` | `200` | An artifact already covers this source set; nothing is queued | untouched |
| `collapsed` | `200` | A concurrent identical request won the conditional write; this one hands back the winner | untouched |

`reused` and `collapsed` are deliberately distinct: the first says "this content
was already generated, possibly days ago", the second says "this was the same
tap". Both leave every quota counter untouched, and both are logged under their
own event (`artifact.reused`, `artifact.collapsed`).

**A source still being prepared is not a refusal** (task-360). A request whose
transcription has not finished is *accepted*: the entry is written `queued`
exactly like any other, `created` is returned with the same `202`, the quota is
debited once there and then, and nothing is put on the generation queue yet. The
end of the ingestion (`media_completed_worker`) is the join point that enqueues
it, with no second call from the client. So the entry appears in
`GET /api/artifacts?scope=…` as `queued` from the moment of the tap, survives
leaving the screen, and turns into `generating` then `ready` by itself. The
deferred request and the generation that follows it are **one entry and one
debit**: the `artifact_id` hashes the sources still in preparation in alongside the
readable ones, so the id does not move when they land.

Transcription is the **only** preparation a generation ever waits on. A media in
a language the user does not read is generated immediately: the corpus is each
source's original transcript and the output language travels in the prompt, via
`parameters["language"]` (the requester's reading language, part of the
`artifact_id` hash). Nothing on this endpoint translates a transcript, so a
foreign media asked for the second it lands starts straight away (task-398). The
reader's full-text translation (`GET /api/media/{id}/raw-content`) is a separate,
non-blocking path and is unaffected.

A wait is bounded. `awaiting_expires_at` is stamped on the entry
(`ARTIFACT_AWAITING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, one hour by default) and an expired wait
becomes `failed` with `sources_preparation_timeout` — no entry stays `queued`
forever. A preparation that will not complete ends the wait early with
`sources_preparation_failed`: an ingestion that failed or produced no readable
transcript. `sources_changed` is the residual case where the scope's
sources moved while the entry waited, so the generation would no longer be the one
that was asked for.

Typed refusals:

| Situation | Status | `error_code` | Retryable |
|---|---|---|---|
| No source at all in the scope, or every source definitively unusable | `422` | `scope_empty` | no |
| More than 25 sources, or more than 120 000 estimated tokens | `422` | `scope_too_large` | no |
| Out of minutes (folder scope only) | `403` | `out_of_minutes` | next period, or on upgrade |
| Artifact type disabled | `400` | — | no |
| Generation disabled globally | `503` | — | no |

`scope_too_large` carries the four numbers the client displays, so it computes
nothing: `source_count`, `max_sources`, `estimated_tokens`, `max_tokens`.

There is no `409` on this endpoint any more: the two situations that produced one
are both gone. A source still being prepared is waited on rather than refused
(task-360), and a source in a foreign language is read as it is (task-398), so no
generation can be blocked by the state of a translation.

A generation over a **single item** is free — its LLM cost is already inside what
the item cost to ingest — so `out_of_minutes` can only ever come back on
`scope=folder`, where the cost scales with the sources behind it (one minute per
five sources). Its `message` names the figures and the app shows it verbatim.

### 4) GET /api/artifacts?scope=&scope_id=

A scope's whole history, **newest first, all types mixed**, several entries of the
same type included. This is also the progress endpoint: in-flight entries appear
with `queued` or `generating`, so a client polls once per scope and never once per
artifact type.

```json
{
  "scope": "folder",
  "scope_id": "c4ef2e55-8449-4a71-be46-bcf1a6eeca3e",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "artifact_id": "art_9f3c...",
      "artifact_type": "summary_detailed",
      "status": "ready",
      "title": "Les limites du scaling",
      "source_count": 7,
      "created_at": "2026-08-17T09:12:44Z",
      "completed_at": "2026-08-17T09:13:31Z",
      "error_code": null
    },
    {
      "artifact_id": "art_1b70...",
      "artifact_type": "quiz",
      "status": "generating",
      "title": null,
      "source_count": 7,
      "created_at": "2026-08-17T09:12:44Z",
      "completed_at": null,
      "error_code": null
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": null
}
```

These are exactly the attributes the `scope-index` GSI projects: a page costs one
DynamoDB query, with no read of the base table and no S3 access. `title` is
emitted by the model, which is what tells two entries of the same type apart.
`sources` is **not** in this response — it is only returned when one entry is
opened.

### 5) GET /api/artifacts/{artifact_id}

The same fields plus the scope and the immutable source snapshot:

```json
{
  "artifact_id": "art_9f3c...",
  "artifact_type": "summary_detailed",
  "status": "ready",
  "title": "Les limites du scaling",
  "source_count": 7,
  "created_at": "2026-08-17T09:12:44Z",
  "completed_at": "2026-08-17T09:13:31Z",
  "error_code": null,
  "scope": "folder",
  "scope_id": "c4ef2e55-8449-4a71-be46-bcf1a6eeca3e",
  "sources": [
    {
      "media_item_id": "med_01JQ8X8J...",
      "title": "Scaling laws revisited",
      "language": "fr",
      "excluded": false,
      "excluded_reason": null
    }
  ],
  "s3_key": "summary_detailed/art_9f3c....json"
}
```

A source with `excluded: true` was in the scope but carried no usable transcript:
it is recorded rather than dropped, so the entry stays honest about what it could
not read. The snapshot describes the scope **at generation time** — it is expected
to diverge from the folder's current contents, and that divergence is the
history rather than a defect.

### 6) GET /api/artifacts/{artifact_id}/content

The stored JSON payload, inlined. `409` while the entry is not `ready`, as a typed
refusal whose `error_code` — never the message text — says whether the entry is
still coming (task-328):

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "error_code": "artifact_not_ready",
    "message": "Artifact is still being generated (status: generating). Try again once generation completes.",
    "status": "generating"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "error_code": "artifact_failed",
    "message": "Artifact generation failed and will not resume on its own. Request a new generation for this scope and type.",
    "status": "failed",
    "artifact_error_code": "LLM_ERROR",
    "scope": "media",
    "scope_id": "med_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7",
    "artifact_type": "notes"
  }
}
```

`artifact_not_ready` resolves on its own, so a client may come back to it.
`artifact_failed` is **terminal**: no worker will pick the entry up again, and a
client that keeps polling it polls forever. The refusal therefore carries the
`scope`, `scope_id` and `artifact_type` a new generation needs, so a failure state
can offer `POST /api/artifacts` without a second round-trip — that request reruns
the entry under its own id (`generation_outcome: "retried"`) and debits nothing
extra.

```json
{
  "artifact_id": "art_01JQ8ZNOTES...",
  "artifact_type": "notes",
  "scope": "media",
  "scope_id": "med_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7",
  "status": "ready",
  "content": {
    "artifact_id": "art_01JQ8ZNOTES...",
    "artifact_type": "notes",
    "scope": "media",
    "scope_id": "med_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7",
    "generated_at": "2026-02-24T20:37:10Z",
    "source_count": 1,
    "sources": [
      {
        "media_item_id": "med_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7",
        "title": "LE MEILLEUR DE BOUVARD",
        "language": "fr",
        "transcript_s3_key": "job_01JQ8X8J5T9Q5V7Q4TW4N1HY03.txt"
      }
    ],
    "generator_version": "notes:gpt-5.4-nano-2026-03-17:prompt-v4",
    "llm_usage": {
      "prompt_tokens": 4622,
      "cached_tokens": 0,
      "completion_tokens": 1200,
      "cost_eur": 0.0016
    },
    "content": {
      "title": "...",
      "objectives": ["..."],
      "concepts": [
        {
          "term": "...",
          "explanation": "...",
          "importance": "core"
        }
      ],
      "key_points": ["..."],
      "action_items": ["..."],
      "glossary": [
        {
          "term": "...",
          "definition": "..."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Every content schema carries a `title` (3-80 characters) emitted by the model.
`summary_detailed.notable_quotes` is a list of `{text, source_ref}` where
`source_ref` is **required** — a quote is verbatim, so its origin is checkable.
Flashcards and quiz questions carry an **optional** `source_ref`, null when the
entry draws on several sources. `source_ref` is the corpus tag (`"[S2]"`), which
the client resolves through the index in `sources`; the model is never asked to
write a media id.

Canonical `notes` content shape for client rendering:
```json
{
  "artifact_id": "art_...",
  "media_item_id": "med_...",
  "artifact_type": "notes",
  "generated_at": "ISO-8601",
  "source": {
    "transcript_s3_key": "...",
    "generator_version": "notes:...:prompt-v1"
  },
  "content": {
    "objectives": [
      "..."
    ],
    "concepts": [
      {
        "term": "...",
        "explanation": "...",
        "importance": "core"
      }
    ],
    "key_points": [
      "..."
    ],
    "action_items": [
      "..."
    ],
    "glossary": [
      {
        "term": "...",
        "definition": "..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Malformed `notes` model output is handled with strict validation:
- strip optional markdown fences
- parse JSON
- validate required sections and item shapes
- mark artifact `failed` with `VALIDATION_ERROR` if validation fails
- never persist a degraded fallback payload as `ready`

### 7) DELETE /api/media/{media_item_id}

No request body.

Response (`DeleteMediaResponse`):
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "media_item_id": "mi_9f2c1d0b7a4e5f6081c2d3e4f5a6b7c8",
  "deleted_at": "2026-08-13T09:41:02+00:00",
  "purge_at": 1758620462,
  "grace_days": 30
}
```

Semantics (task-243, §6.2 of the task-218 benchmark):
- the item leaves every read surface immediately: library reads skip soft-deleted rows and the search records are deleted synchronously
- `purge_at` is epoch seconds; after it, the row and its search records are destroyed
  irreversibly by the lifecycle worker; content-scoped artifacts and processing
  objects survive while another retained save row still references the same `media_key`
- inside the grace window a deletion is recoverable by support (clear `deleted_at`/`purge_at`)
- idempotent: deleting an already-deleted item returns `200` with the original `purge_at`, never `404`, and never pushes the purge date out
- re-ingesting the same URL creates a separate visible save with a new `media_item_id`;
  it does not revive or mutate the soft-deleted row
- `media_item_id` in the response is the same durable library id supplied in the path
- unknown or foreign id returns `404 MEDIA_NOT_FOUND`
- this is the only endpoint in the system allowed to schedule a library row for purge; retention rules are in `docs/DATA_RETENTION.md`

### 8) PATCH /api/media/{media_id}

Partial update of one library item: where it is filed, what it is called, or both.

Request (`PatchMediaRequest`):
```json
{
  "folder_id": "fld_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7",
  "title": "Commonplace book"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `folder_id` | string or null | no | Destination folder, `null` meaning Uncategorized. Routed to `folder_service.assign_folder_to_media`. |
| `title` | string | no | New user-facing title. Trimmed, with runs of whitespace collapsed, then **1 to 120 characters** (`MAX_TITLE_LENGTH` in `media_summarizer/core/media_ingestion/title_derivation.py` — the same ceiling ingestion derives titles under). Routed to `user_media.update_attributes`. |

Response (`PatchMediaResponse`):
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "media_id": "mi_9f2c1d0b7a4e5f6081c2d3e4f5a6b7c8",
  "folder_id": "fld_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7",
  "previous_folder_id": null,
  "title": "Commonplace book"
}
```

Semantics (task-264 for the folder half, task-346 for the title half):
- **which fields the body carries** drives the dispatch, not their value: an explicit `"folder_id": null` (move to Uncategorized) stays distinguishable from a body that says nothing about the folder
- the response reports only what the patch touched — `folder_id`/`previous_folder_id` are absent on a title-only patch, `title` is absent on a folder-only one
- a body carrying neither field is refused with `400 BAD_REQUEST` ("Nothing to update"), never answered with a success that changed no row
- a title that is blank, whitespace-only, or longer than the bound is refused with `422 VALIDATION_ERROR`; the value is normalized before storage, so what the response carries is what the library holds
- ownership is the `(user_id, media_item_id)` key itself, as for the folder move; an unknown or foreign id returns `404 MEDIA_NOT_FOUND`
- a rename also refreshes the `title` denormalized onto that media's search chunks (selected by the `media_item_id` filter), so results stop matching and displaying the old name. That refresh is best-effort: a search-index failure is logged as `user_media.rename_search_failed` and does not fail the request — the library row is the source of truth
- a rename touches the user-facing title only: `media_key`, `saved_at`, dedup identity and artifacts are untouched
- the path parameter is spelled `media_id` on this route; it carries the same durable library id as `{media_item_id}` elsewhere

## File upload entrypoints (non-canonical, same organization contract)

Three ingestion entrypoints work from a file instead of a URL: `POST /api/media/upload`,
`POST /api/media/upload-audio`, and `POST /api/media/ingest-shared-content` with
`share_type=audio`. They are **not** part of the six canonical endpoints above and have their own
compact response shapes, but since task-264 they accept the same organization fields as
`POST /api/media/ingest-url`. There is one dialect for "where does this save go", implemented once in
`_resolve_media_organization` (`media_summarizer/api/endpoints/media.py`) and shared by all four.

**No endpoint of this API ever receives a file.** Requests arrive through API Gateway, which
base64-encodes the body into the Lambda event, so Lambda's 6 MiB synchronous payload ceiling caps any
HTTP body at **4 718 592 raw bytes** — and past that the gateway answers `Request Entity Too Large`
itself, before FastAPI, so the API cannot even shape the error. Since task-345 the client uploads
straight to S3 and the endpoints take JSON carrying the resulting key.

### POST /api/media/upload-url

`application/json`. Issues a presigned S3 PUT. Same pattern as
`POST /api/bug-reports/upload-url`.

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `target` | string | yes | `document`, `audio` or `shared_audio` — which of the three flows the file is for. Decides the bucket, the accepted formats and the ceiling. |
| `filename` | string | yes | Name including its extension; it is what the format check reads, and it is kept in the key. Any path component is stripped. |
| `content_type` | string | no | MIME type the client will send with the PUT. Required for `shared_audio`, whose check is MIME-based. |
| `file_size` | integer | yes | Bytes. Checked against the ceiling before signing, so a hopeless transfer never starts. Re-checked from S3 at submission — the client's figure is never trusted. |

Response (`200 OK`):
```json
{
  "upload_url": "https://<bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/uploads/usr_01JQ.../3f1c.../invoice-2026-03.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=...",
  "upload_key": "uploads/usr_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7/3f1c9a2e.../invoice-2026-03.pdf",
  "expires_in": 900
}
```

The client then sends the raw bytes with `PUT` to `upload_url`, **without** the `Authorization`
header: the signature is the credential, and the session must not travel to a host that is not this
API. Ceilings are `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_BYTES` (50 MB) for `document` and `audio`,
`MAX_SHARED_AUDIO_SIZE_BYTES` (25 MB) for `shared_audio`; both are mirrored in the mobile client
(`mobile/src/types/upload.ts`, `mobile/src/types/sharedContent.ts`).

### POST /api/media/upload

`application/json`:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `upload_key` | string | yes | Key returned by `upload-url` for `target=document`. Extension must be in `DocumentFormat.supported_extensions()`: `pdf`, `docx`, `pptx`, `xlsx`, `txt`, `text`, `md`, `markdown`, `rtf`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `tiff`, `tif`, `bmp`, `heif`, `heic`. Images go through OCR. The text formats are decoded in-process by `PlainTextResolver` — no provider call, no page count, nothing debited (task-380). |
| `folder_id` | string \| null | no | Destination folder. Omitted or null means the user's default Uncategorized folder. |

Response (`UploadDocumentResponse`, `202 Accepted`):
```json
{
  "media_item_id": "med_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7",
  "status": "processing",
  "source_platform": "document",
  "file_name": "invoice-2026-03.pdf"
}
```

### POST /api/media/upload-audio

`application/json`:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `upload_key` | string | yes | Key returned by `upload-url` for `target=audio`. Extension must be one of `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.aac`, `.ogg`, `.wav`, `.flac`, `.opus`. Transcribed by Deepgram. |
| `folder_id` | string \| null | no | Same semantics as above. |

Response (`UploadAudioResponse`, `202 Accepted`):
```json
{
  "media_item_id": "med_01JQ8X8J5S3H3CXX8V70M9M3K7",
  "status": "processing",
  "source_platform": "audio"
}
```

### Shared semantics

- `folder_id` is validated against the caller **before** the quota check, so an unusable folder
  costs nothing to the user's allowance. An id that does not exist or belongs to someone else is
  `400 Folder not found` — identical wording and status to `ingest-url`.
- It lands on the durable library row through `save_media_for_user`, never on the processing job —
  organization belongs to what the user saved, not to the pipeline working for it.
- An `upload_key` that does not start with `uploads/{caller_id}/` is `403`, decided on the key alone
  **before any S3 call**, so these endpoints cannot be used to probe another user's objects.
- An `upload_key` with no object behind it is `422` naming the missing upload: the transfer either
  never happened or has expired. The key is single-use — the object is moved to its canonical
  location and the staged copy deleted — so replaying the same submission gets this same `422`.
- Rejections that do not depend on the file's content are stable: unsupported extension or MIME
  `400`, empty object `400`, over the ceiling `413`. Extension and size are checked twice, once at
  `upload-url` (so a refusal costs no transfer) and once at submission against what S3 actually
  holds.
- **The content identity of an uploaded file is a fingerprint of its bytes, inside the account**
  (task-393). The API never sees the body, so the fingerprint comes from S3: the object's ETag when
  it is the MD5 of the body (single-part PUT, SSE-S3 — pinned on both staging buckets), otherwise a
  full-object checksum S3 stored for it. Consequences a client can rely on: the same file submitted
  twice under two different names is one content, and two different files that happen to share a
  name and a byte count are two. The owner is part of the identity, so two accounts uploading
  identical bytes share neither content nor artifacts. When S3 reports no digest that is a function
  of the body alone — a multipart upload, or an object encrypted with a KMS or client-supplied key —
  the submission is refused with `422` and an `X-Upload-Error-Code` header
  (`upload_fingerprint_multipart`, `upload_fingerprint_encrypted`, `upload_fingerprint_missing`)
  rather than being keyed on something that does not identify it.
- A consumption refusal carries the `X-Quota-Error-Code` header (`out_of_minutes` or
  `item_too_long`), exactly like the URL and shared-content entrypoints. For an audio upload the
  duration is read from the object over a presigned GET (a few Range requests) before the debit, so
  the "too long for one import" refusal still happens before anything is committed.
- The library row stores `media_type` `document` / `audio`, which the list endpoint returns as-is;
  `GET /api/media/{media_item_id}` normalizes them to the canonical `article` / `audio_file`.
- Objects the client uploads and never submits stay under `uploads/` and expire after one day
  through the bucket lifecycle rule (`infrastructure/terraform/modules/platform/s3.tf`).

## Domain enums (locked)

`MediaItem`:
- `status`: `ingested | resolving | processing | ready_for_artifacts | failed | cancelled`
- `transcript.status`: `pending | extracting | transcribing | ready | failed`
- `review_blurb_status`: `pending | ready | failed` — the source preview shown above the
  full text. `review_blurb` itself is null unless this reads `ready`, and the status is what
  tells a client whether that null is a preview on its way or one that will never come: the
  generation is an internal artifact triggered best-effort at the end of ingestion, so no entry
  at all on a finished item reads as `failed` (repaired by
  `media_summarizer/scripts/backfill_review_blurbs.py`). **`pending` is bounded** (task-391):
  an entry left in flight past `ARTIFACT_INTERNAL_STALL_SECONDS` (30 min) is ended by the read
  itself and answers `failed`, so no item stays "preview being written" for ever. A save of
  content someone already ingested provisions its own preview at save time, from the content's
  existing artifact or from a generation of its own, so a deduplicated save never announces
  `ready` over a row that carries nothing.

`MediaArtifact`:
- `scope`: `media | folder`
- `artifact_type`: `summary_short | summary_detailed | notes | quiz | flashcards`
- `status`: `queued | generating | ready | failed`

`ProcessingJob` lifecycle usage:
- `pending | classifying | resolving | downloading | extracting | transcribing | ready_for_artifacts | completed | failed | cancelled`

## Transitional status mapping (legacy -> canonical)

When reading existing `ProcessingJob.status` values during migration:
- `pending` -> `pending`
- `rss_resolving` -> `resolving`
- `downloading` -> `downloading`
- `transcribing` -> `transcribing`
- `summarizing` -> `ready_for_artifacts`
- `notifying` -> `completed`
- `completed` -> `completed`
- `failed` -> `failed`
- `cancelled` -> `cancelled`

## Error contract (stable)

Canonical error response:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_URL",
    "message": "The provided URL is invalid.",
    "request_id": "0d4b1c81-a8d1-4ff2-88f9-8af0c1fdf6ba"
  },
  "detail": "Invalid URL"
}
```

Stable error codes:
- `BAD_REQUEST`
- `INVALID_URL`
- `UNSUPPORTED_URL`
- `SESSION_EXPIRED`
- `NOT_AUTHORIZED`
- `NOT_FOUND`
- `MEDIA_NOT_FOUND`
- `ARTIFACT_NOT_FOUND`
- `CONFLICT`
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`
- `RATE_LIMITED`
- `PAYMENT_REQUIRED`
- `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`
- `INSUFFICIENT_MINUTES`
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`

HTTP mapping rules:
- `400`: input/URL errors (`BAD_REQUEST`, `INVALID_URL`, `UNSUPPORTED_URL`)
- `401`: `SESSION_EXPIRED`
- `403`: `NOT_AUTHORIZED`
- `404`: not-found family (`NOT_FOUND`, `MEDIA_NOT_FOUND`, `ARTIFACT_NOT_FOUND`)
- `409`: `CONFLICT`
- `422`: `VALIDATION_ERROR`
- `429`: `RATE_LIMITED`
- `402`: `PAYMENT_REQUIRED`, `INSUFFICIENT_MINUTES`, `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`
- `500`: `INTERNAL_ERROR` (user-safe message only)

## Contract invariants

- `media_key` must be deterministic from canonical URL normalization.
- Processing is idempotent for equivalent normalized URLs; saving is intentionally
  non-idempotent and creates a fresh library row on every successful request.
- Artifact creation generates **only** when `(user, scope, scope_id, artifact_type, parameters, sorted source ids)` has no entry yet, or when the entry it has is `failed`. Any other identical request — a double tap or one months later — returns the stored entry, with no new generation and no quota movement. The storage stays an append-only history: a *different* source set writes a new entry next to the older ones, and no request is ever refused for already existing.
- Timestamps use ISO-8601 UTC strings.
- `request_id` must be returned in error payload and response header.

## Relationship to existing runtime APIs

Current runtime still exposes legacy paths:
- `/api/podcast-search/*`
- `/api/jobs/*`

These legacy paths are not the canonical target contract and must not drive new mobile share-first implementation once canonical endpoints are implemented. As of 2026-08-18 neither has a single caller left in `mobile/` — the constraint has held, and what remains is backend surface nothing consumes. `/api/episodes/my-episodes` was listed here too and no longer exists; its router is not mounted.

The paths named above carry no active mobile callers and exist only to prevent breaking pre-existing API integrations (unlikely given zero shipped clients). Whether they should exist at all is out of scope of this API harmonization; that is a separate product decision.
