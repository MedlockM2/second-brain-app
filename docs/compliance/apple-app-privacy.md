**Media Summarizer**
**Last updated:** 2026-05-19

This document describes the App Privacy disclosures required for the Apple App Store submission. These answers correspond to the App Privacy section in App Store Connect.

## Privacy Policy URL

`https://mediasummarizer.com/privacy` (must be publicly accessible before submission)

---

## Data Collection Declaration

**Does your app collect data?** Yes

---

## Data Types Collected

### 1. Contact Info

| Data Type | Collected | Linked to Identity | Used for Tracking |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Email Address | Yes | Yes | No |

**Purpose:** App Functionality, Account Registration

---

### 2. User Content

| Data Type | Collected | Linked to Identity | Used for Tracking |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Other User Content | Yes | Yes | No |

**Description:** URLs shared by the user for media processing, and AI-generated artifacts (summaries, notes, quizzes) derived from that content.

**Purpose:** App Functionality

---

### 3. Identifiers

| Data Type | Collected | Linked to Identity | Used for Tracking |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| User ID | Yes | Yes | No |
| Device ID | Yes | Yes | No |

**Description of Device ID:** the Expo push notification token, collected only if
the user allows notifications, and used only to deliver that account's daily and
weekly digest alerts to that device. It is not an advertising identifier, it is
never shared for tracking, and it is deleted at sign-out, at account deletion, and
after 90 days without the app registering it again.

**Purpose:** App Functionality

---

### 4. Usage Data

| Data Type | Collected | Linked to Identity | Used for Tracking |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Product Interaction | Yes | Yes | No |

**Description:** Screens visited, features used, session duration for product improvement.

**Purpose:** Analytics

---

### 5. Diagnostics

| Data Type | Collected | Linked to Identity | Used for Tracking |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Crash Data | Yes | No | No |
| Performance Data | Yes | No | No |

**Purpose:** App Functionality (stability improvement)

---

## Data NOT Collected

The following data types are NOT collected by Media Summarizer:

- Health & Fitness
- Financial Info
- Location
- Sensitive Info
- Contacts
- Browsing History (we only store URLs explicitly submitted by the user, not browsing activity)
- Search History (in-app search queries are not persisted server-side)
- Purchases
- Photos or Videos (photo library permission exists but no photos are uploaded to our servers)
- Audio Data (audio is fetched from third-party URLs, not from the user's device microphone)
- Other Diagnostic Data

---

## Tracking Declaration

**Does your app track users?** No

We do not:

- Link user data with third-party data for advertising purposes
- Share user data with data brokers
- Use advertising identifiers (IDFA)
- Participate in cross-app tracking

The app does NOT use the AppTrackingTransparency framework because no tracking occurs.

---

## Third-Party SDKs / Services

| SDK/Service | Data Accessed | Purpose |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Expo | Device info, crash data | App framework, OTA updates |
| Sentry (`@sentry/react-native`) | Crash data: stack trace, device model, OS version, app version/build, recent in-app events | Crash and error reporting |
| Deepgram (server-side only) | Audio content from URLs | Transcription |
| OpenAI (server-side only) | Text content | AI generation |

Note: Deepgram and OpenAI are called server-side only (from our backend), not from the app directly. They do not have SDKs embedded in the app binary.

Sentry *is* embedded in the app (task-413) and is covered by the existing "Crash Data — Not linked to identity" answer above. That answer holds only while the app never attaches an identity to Sentry: `src/lib/crashReporting.ts` runs with `sendDefaultPii: false` and never calls `Sentry.setUser`. Adding either would make crash data linked to the user, and this declaration would have to change with it.

---

## Data Linked to You (Summary for App Store Label)

The following data is collected and linked to your identity:

- Email Address
- User ID
- User Content (submitted URLs, generated artifacts)
- Product Interaction data

## Data Not Linked to You (Summary for App Store Label)

The following data may be collected but is not linked to your identity:

- Crash Data
- Performance Data

---

## Notes for Review

- No advertising SDKs are present in the app
- No third-party analytics SDKs that track across apps
- Authentication tokens are stored in iOS Keychain via expo-secure-store
- The share extension (MediaSummarizerShare) accesses the same App Group data but does not independently collect or transmit data; it passes URLs to the main app's processing pipeline
