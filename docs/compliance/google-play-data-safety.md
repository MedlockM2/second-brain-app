## Overview Section

### Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types?

**Yes**

### Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit?

**Yes** - All network communication uses HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)

### Do you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted?

**Yes** - Users can delete individual items in-app and request full account deletion

|-------|-------|
| Collected | Yes |
| Shared | No |
| Ephemeral | No |

| Purpose | App functionality, Account management |

---

### 2. App Activity

#### In-app search history

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Collected | No |
| Note | Search queries are processed client-side or ephemeral; not persisted on server |

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Collected | Yes |
| Shared | No |
| Ephemeral | No |
| Required | Yes |
| Purpose | App functionality |
| Description | URLs submitted for processing and AI-generated artifacts (summaries, notes, quizzes) |

### 3. App Info and Performance

#### Crash logs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Collected | Yes |
| Shared | No |
| Ephemeral | No |
| Required | No (automatic) |
| Purpose | App functionality (debugging and stability) |

#### Diagnostics

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Collected | Yes |
| Shared | No |
| Ephemeral | No |
| Required | No (automatic) |
| Purpose | App functionality (performance monitoring) |

### 4. Device or Other IDs

#### Device or other IDs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Collected | Yes (push notification token only) |
| Shared | Yes (Expo push service, to deliver the notification) |
| Ephemeral | No |
| Required | No - only if the user allows notifications |
| Purpose | App functionality (daily and weekly digest notifications) |
| Note | We do not collect the Android Advertising ID. The only identifier is the Expo push token, which addresses one device and nothing else; it is deleted at sign-out, at account deletion, and after 90 days without the app registering it again. |

---

## Data NOT Collected

The following categories are NOT collected:

- **Location** (approximate or precise)
- **Financial info** (purchase history, credit card, etc.)
- **Health and fitness**
- **Messages** (emails, SMS, other messages)
- **Photos and videos**
- **Audio files** (from device; we fetch audio from third-party URLs server-side)
- **Files and docs**
- **Calendar**
- **Contacts**
- **Web browsing** (we store only explicitly submitted URLs, not browsing history)

---

## Data Shared

**No data is shared with third parties** for purposes outside of providing the core Service.

Note on processors: Our backend sends content to Deepgram (transcription) and OpenAI (AI generation) to provide core app functionality, and the app itself sends crash reports to Sentry. Per Google's Data Safety guidance, transfers to service providers acting as data processors on our behalf are disclosed as follows:

| Service Provider | Data Processed | Purpose | Retained by Provider |
|-----------------|----------------|---------|---------------------|
| Deepgram | Audio from submitted URLs | Transcription | No (deleted after processing) |
| OpenAI | Text content | AI artifact generation | No (API usage, not used for training) |
| Sentry (SDK in the app, task-413) | Crash logs and diagnostics: stack trace, device model, OS version, app version/build, recent in-app events; no account identifier | Crash and error reporting (the "Crash logs" answer above) | Yes, for the project's event retention period (within the 6 months stated in the privacy policy) |

These are **not** considered "sharing" under Google Play Data Safety because these providers act as processors under our instructions and do not use the data for independent purposes.

---

## Security Practices

| Practice | Implemented |
|----------|-------------|
| Data encrypted in transit | Yes (TLS 1.2+) |
| Data encrypted at rest | Yes (AWS managed encryption) |
| Secure credential storage | Yes (Android Keystore via expo-secure-store) |
| Data deletion mechanism | Yes (in-app + account deletion) |
| Security review/audit | Planned before production launch |

---

## Data Deletion

### Can users request data deletion?

**Yes**

### How can users request deletion?

1. **In-app:** Users can delete individual media items and their associated artifacts
2. **Account deletion:** In-app, from Account > Delete Account (no support request needed)
3. **Email:** Users can email privacy@mediasummarizer.com to request full data deletion, for users who lost access to the app

### Deletion timeline

- Individual items: deleted immediately
- Full account deletion: erased from live systems immediately; encrypted infrastructure backups expire within 35 days

### What data may be retained after deletion?

- Aggregated, anonymized analytics data (cannot be linked back to the user)
- Data required to be retained by law (if applicable)

## Notes for Review

- The app uses Android intent filters to receive shared text/URLs from other apps. This is standard share-sheet functionality, not data collection from other apps.
- No Google Play Install Referrer or Advertising ID is used
- No ad SDKs are present
- The `android.permission.INTERNET` permission is used for API communication only
