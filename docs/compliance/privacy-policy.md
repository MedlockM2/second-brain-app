# Privacy Policy

**Media Summarizer**
**Last updated:** 2026-08-12
**Effective date:** 2026-08-12

## 1. Introduction

Media Summarizer ("we", "us", "our") operates the Media Summarizer mobile application (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Service.

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Account Information

When you create an account, we collect:

- **Email address** - used for authentication, account recovery, and service communications
- **Password** - stored in hashed form; we never store or have access to your plaintext password

### 2.2 User-Submitted Content

When you use the Service, we collect:

- **URLs you share** - web articles, podcast episodes, YouTube videos, and other media links you submit for processing
- **Source application metadata** - which app you shared from (e.g., Safari, YouTube, Spotify)

### 2.3 Generated Content

The Service creates and stores:

- **Transcripts** - text transcriptions of audio/video content
- **Summaries** - AI-generated summaries of your submitted media
- **Notes** - AI-generated study notes
- **Quizzes** - AI-generated flashcards and quiz questions

### 2.4 Usage Data

We automatically collect:

- **App usage analytics** - screens visited, features used, session duration
- **Device information** - device model, operating system version, app version
- **Crash reports** - error logs to improve app stability

### 2.5 Push Notification Token

If you allow notifications, your device gives us a **push notification token** - an
identifier issued by the Expo push service that lets a notification reach that
specific device, and nothing else. It is not linked to any advertising identifier
and is never used to track you across apps.

Notifications are entirely optional: declining the permission leaves every part of
the Service working, and we never ask a second time. You can turn them off at any
moment in your device's system settings.

### 2.6 Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect location data
- We do not access your contacts, photos, or camera (except photo library access if you explicitly attach an image)
- We do not collect financial or payment information directly (handled by Apple/Google)
- We do not collect health, fitness, or biometric data

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your information for the following purposes:

| Purpose | Data Used |
|---------|-----------|
| Provide the Service | Email, URLs, generated content |
| Authentication | Email, password hash |
| Content processing | Submitted URLs, transcripts |
| AI artifact generation | Transcripts |
| Service improvement | Usage analytics, crash reports |
| Account communications | Email address |
| Daily and weekly digest notifications | Push notification token, time zone |

## 4. How We Process Your Data

### 4.1 Transcription

Audio and video content from your submitted URLs is transcribed using **Deepgram**, a third-party speech-to-text service. Deepgram processes audio data to produce text transcripts. Deepgram's privacy policy applies to their processing of this data. Deepgram does not retain audio data after transcription is complete.

### 4.2 AI Generation

Transcripts and extracted text are processed by **OpenAI** GPT models to generate summaries, notes, and quizzes. OpenAI processes text data according to their API data usage policy. When using the API, OpenAI does not use submitted data to train their models.

### 4.3 Push Notifications

If you allow notifications, your daily and weekly digest alerts are delivered
through **Expo**'s push notification service, which passes them on to Apple (APNs)
or Google (FCM). Only two things travel: your device's push token and the
notification itself, whose text is a count - "You saved 3 items today" - and never
the title, the source or any part of what you saved. Opening the notification is
what shows you the digest, from your own authenticated session.

### 4.4 Data Flow Summary

```
User submits URL -> Our backend fetches content -> Deepgram transcribes audio
-> OpenAI generates artifacts -> Results stored in our infrastructure
```

## 5. Data Storage and Security

### 5.1 Infrastructure

All data is stored on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** infrastructure:

- **DynamoDB** - account data, media metadata, artifact content
- **S3** - transcript files, processed content
- **SQS** - job processing queues (transient, messages deleted after processing)

### 5.2 Security Measures

- All data in transit is encrypted via TLS 1.2+
- Data at rest is encrypted using AWS-managed encryption keys
- Authentication tokens are stored securely on-device using platform-native secure storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore)
- Passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms before storage
- Access to production infrastructure is restricted and audited

### 5.3 Data Location

Our infrastructure is hosted in AWS regions within the United States. By using the Service, you consent to your data being transferred to and processed in the United States.

## 6. Data Sharing and Third Parties

We share data with the following third-party services solely for the purpose of providing the Service:

| Service | Data Shared | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Deepgram | Audio content from URLs | Transcription |
| OpenAI | Text content, transcripts | AI artifact generation |
| Expo | Push notification token, notification text (a count) | Delivering digest notifications |
| Sentry | Crash and error reports: the error and where in the app it happened, device model, operating system version, app version and build, and the in-app events just before it (no account identifier) | Diagnosing crashes and errors |
| Amazon Web Services | All stored data | Infrastructure hosting |

We do NOT:

- Sell your personal data to third parties
- Share your data for advertising purposes
- Allow third parties to use your data for their own purposes beyond providing our Service
- Use your data for cross-app tracking

## 7. Data Retention

- **Account data** - retained as long as your account is active
- **Submitted URLs and generated artifacts** - retained as long as your account is active
- **Usage analytics** - retained for up to 12 months, then aggregated or deleted
- **Crash reports** - retained for up to 6 months
- **Push notification token** - deleted when you sign out, when your device stops being reachable, after 90 days without the app registering it again, and with your account

When you delete your account from within the app, your account and its content are erased from our live systems straight away: account record, media items, transcripts, summaries, notes, flashcards, stored files and search index entries. Copies held in our encrypted infrastructure backups are not individually editable and expire automatically within 35 days, after which nothing remains. We keep only what the law requires us to keep.

## 8. Your Rights

You have the following rights regarding your data:

### 8.1 Access

You can view all your submitted media, generated artifacts, and account information directly within the app.

The app has no self-service export, so if you want a machine-readable copy of everything we hold about you, email us at **privacy@mediasummarizer.com** from the address on your account. We handle the request manually and answer **within one month** of receiving it, as required by the GDPR. If the request is unusually complex we may extend that period by up to two further months, and we will tell you why before the first month is up.

### 8.2 Deletion

- **Individual items** - you can delete any media item and its associated artifacts at any time
- **Account deletion** - open **Account > Delete Account** in the app. The deletion is permanent, takes effect immediately, and covers everything listed in section 7. We cannot restore a deleted account, so ask for a copy of your data (section 8.1) before you delete it if you want to keep one.
- **By email** - if you cannot reach the app (for example you lost access to your device), email **privacy@mediasummarizer.com** and we will delete the account for you within one month.

Deleting your account does **not** cancel an active App Store or Google Play subscription. Only the store can do that: cancel it in your Apple or Google account settings, otherwise billing continues.

### 8.3 Data Portability

You can ask us for your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or ask us to send it to another controller where technically feasible. As with access requests, this is handled manually: email **privacy@mediasummarizer.com** and we will respond **within one month**.

### 8.4 Correction

You can update your email address through the app's account settings.

### 8.5 Withdrawal of Consent

You can stop using the Service at any time. Deleting your account removes your data as described above.

## 9. Children's Privacy

The Service is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by:

- Posting the updated policy within the app
- Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this document
- Sending an email notification for significant changes

Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
