# Ingestion Workers and Providers Reference

Authoritative reference for the ingestion pipeline. Lists each source type's
primary extraction path, fallback chain, terminal failure behavior, and
downstream hand-off.

Last verified against codebase: 2026-09-09 (task-383: the author's description is persisted on the job and enters the artifact corpus; nothing descriptive is handed to Deepgram).

## Article

**Source type**: `web_article` — a recognised type since task-392, decided by
`classify_source_type` on its own criterion, not the last `else` of the chain.
**Reader (shared)**: `media_summarizer/infrastructure/resolvers/trafilatura_article_resolver.py`
(`ArticleContentFetcherPort`, defined in `core/ports/article_content.py`)
**Two callers, one reader**:

| Caller | When | Timeout |
|---|---|---|
| `ArticleResolver` (`core/media_ingestion/adapters/resolvers.py`) | a user saves a URL — **inside the HTTP request** | `ARTICLE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (12 s, against the API's 30 s ceiling) |
| `workers/article_extraction_worker.py` | an item published by `rss_feed_poll_worker`, job already created | `ARTICLE_EXTRACT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (20 s) |

The API path reads the page *before* the content identity is settled, because
`media_key` for an article is `sha256` over the canonical URL **and** a `sha256` of
the extracted text: a page that was rewritten is a different media (task-392). The
fingerprint is taken on the extracted, already-normalized text — never on the raw
HTML, whose ads and CSRF tokens would make every save a new media.

### Primary path

| Provider/library | Identifier | Extracts | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| trafilatura | `trafilatura.extract()` | Clean text from HTML (no comments, tables, links) | `TRANSCRIPT_BUCKET`, `ARTICLE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `ARTICLE_EXTRACT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `ARTICLE_EXTRACT_MAX_HTML_BYTES`, `ARTICLE_EXTRACT_USER_AGENT`, `ARTICLE_EXTRACTION_QUEUE` (RSS path only) |

Workflow (identical in both callers, since both go through the port):
1. HTTP GET the normalized URL via `httpx` (streaming, respects `ARTICLE_EXTRACT_MAX_HTML_BYTES`)
2. Validate `Content-Type` is `text/html` or `application/xhtml+xml`
3. Extract clean text with `trafilatura.extract(output_format="txt")`
4. Upload text to S3 as `{job_id}.txt`
5. Publish `episode_completion_status(status=success)` to `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE`

On the API path, steps 4-5 happen in `ProcessingJobSubmissionOrchestrator._settle_article_submission`: nothing is enqueued, the job is already completed when the request returns.

Ref: `trafilatura_article_resolver.py::TrafilaturaArticleResolver.fetch`, `resolvers.py::ArticleResolver.resolve`

### Fallback chain

No fallback — failure is terminal.

### Terminal failure mode

- Mark `ProcessingJob` as failed (`error_step="article_extraction"`)
- Publish `episode_completion_status(status=failure)` to `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE`
- `ArticleFetchErrorCode` (provider-level, in the port) → user-facing `error_code` → observability `reason` (see [how a failure is written down](#cross-cutting-how-a-failure-is-written-down-task-359)):
  - `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` ← `http_error` / `article_http_error` (+`http_status`, `final_url`), `transport_error` / `article_fetch_transport_error`
  - `NOT_AN_ARTICLE_PAGE` ← `not_html` / `article_unsupported_content_type` (+`content_type`, `final_url`)
  - `ARTICLE_TEXT_NOT_FOUND` ← `page_too_large` / `html_too_large`, `extraction_failed` / `trafilatura_error`, `empty_text` / `empty_text_after_extraction`
  - `PROVIDER_TIMED_OUT` ← `timeout` / `article_fetch_timeout` (+`timeout_seconds`)
  - `INVALID_JOB_MESSAGE` ← `missing_job_id`, `missing_normalized_url`, `processing_job_not_found` (RSS path only)
  - `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` ← `unexpected_error` / `article_fetch_unexpected_exception`, `unexpected_exception`
- **On the API path, a retryable cause releases the idempotence reservation.** A 5xx,
  a timeout or a reset connection deletes the `reserved` ledger row instead of moving
  it to `failed`; a verdict on the page itself (a PDF, no body) keeps the row and
  publishes the failure event. Without that split, one outage would answer every
  later save of that URL with the same failure, for ever, without re-reading it.

Ref: `core/ports/article_content.py::MEDIA_FAILURE_CODE_BY_ARTICLE_FETCH_ERROR`, `orchestrators.py::_fail_unreadable_article`, `article_extraction_worker.py::_mark_job_failed`

### Downstream dependencies

Publishes to `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE` (terminates inline with success/failure event).

---

## Podcast

**Source type**: `podcast`
**Worker file**: `media_summarizer/workers/podcastindex_resolution_worker.py`

### Primary path

| Provider/library | Identifier | Extracts | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| PodcastIndex.org API | `PodcastPlatformResolverRegistry` (Spotify, Apple, Deezer, RSS) | Audio enclosure URL from episode metadata | `PODCASTINDEX_API_KEY`, `PODCASTINDEX_API_SECRET`, `PODCASTINDEX_RESOLUTION_QUEUE`, `PODCASTINDEX_EPISODE_CANDIDATES`, `PODCASTINDEX_MAX_RETRIES` |

Workflow:
1. `podcastindex_resolution_worker` consumes `podcastindex-resolution-queue`
2. Marks the job `EXTRACTING` (was `mark_extracting()` post task-175 — historically `RSS_RESOLVING`)
3. Dispatches via `PodcastPlatformResolverRegistry` based on the source platform:
   - **Spotify**: oEmbed metadata → PodcastIndex `byfeedid` search → episode title fuzzy match
   - **Apple Podcasts**: oEmbed metadata → PodcastIndex `episodes/byitunesid` direct lookup (preferred) with `byfeedid` + title-match fallback when the iTunes-ID lookup misses
   - **Deezer**: Deezer public API metadata → PodcastIndex feed search → episode match
   - **RSS**: Direct feed XML parsing + optional PodcastIndex enrichment
4. Resolved audio URL is enqueued to `deepgram-transcription-queue` with `deepgram_mode="pull"`

Ref: `podcastindex_resolution_worker.py::_resolve_audio_url`, `podcast_platform_resolvers.py::SpotifyPodcastPlatformResolver`, `podcast_platform_resolvers.py::ApplePodcastsPlatformResolver` (line 800 — `byitunesid` path), `podcast_platform_resolvers.py::DeezerPodcastPlatformResolver`, `podcast_platform_resolvers.py::RssPodcastPlatformResolver`

### Fallback chain

| Step | Trigger condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (primary) | `feed_url` + `episode_guid` present in message AND RSS `<podcast:transcript>` tag yields valid transcript | Upload pre-existing transcript to S3, publish completion event, skip Deepgram entirely (provider=`podcasting_2.0`) |
| 2 (fallback) | Tag absent / fetch fails / transcript too short / no `feed_url` or `episode_guid` | Enqueue to `deepgram-transcription-queue` with `deepgram_mode="pull"` (Deepgram fetches the audio enclosure URL directly) |

The Podcasting 2.0 short-circuit is implemented in `podcastindex_resolution_worker.py::_try_rss_transcript_short_circuit` (line 140) which calls `utils/rss_transcript.py::fetch_rss_transcript()`. When successful, the completion event carries `"provider": "podcasting_2.0"` in its `transcription_metadata`.

Ref: `podcastindex_resolution_worker.py::_try_rss_transcript_short_circuit` (line 140), `utils/rss_transcript.py::fetch_rss_transcript`

### Terminal failure mode

- Platform resolver returns a non-resolved outcome → worker raises `RuntimeError` containing the error code
- Error codes: `INVALID_PLATFORM_URL`, `EPISODE_NOT_FOUND`, `AUDIO_URL_NOT_FOUND`, `UPSTREAM_LOOKUP_FAILED`, `UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM` (from `PodcastResolverErrorCode`)
- After SQS max retries (`PODCASTINDEX_WORKER_MAX_RETRIES`, default 3), the job stays in failed state via the base worker's retry handler

Ref: `podcast_resolver_foundation.py::PodcastResolverErrorCode`, `podcastindex_resolution_worker.py::process_message`

### Downstream dependencies

Hands off to `deepgram-transcription-queue` with `deepgram_mode="pull"` (Deepgram fetches the audio host directly — open CDNs like libsyn / simplecast / megaphone / anchor.fm are friendly).

## Shared Apify orchestration

Instagram, TikTok and YouTube use
`media_summarizer/infrastructure/apify_adapter.py` as their only Apify HTTP
adapter. The adapter starts an actor through `POST /v2/acts/{actor}/runs`, adds
one ad-hoc webhook covering `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `ABORTED` and `TIMED-OUT`,
then returns the run and dataset IDs immediately. It never polls a run.

The worker persists the run correlation and continuation context on the
`ProcessingJob` before returning. The authenticated
`POST /api/webhooks/apify` endpoint accepts the terminal notification, checks
that its run and dataset match the current job, and places a continuation on
the same ingestion queue. A conditional DynamoDB claim makes duplicate or stale
callbacks no-ops. The worker then reads the already-terminal dataset through
the adapter and resumes its platform-specific pipeline.

Every start also places a delayed message on that same queue with
`DelaySeconds=900`. It expires a still-waiting job with the explicit
`apify_callback_deadline_exceeded` failure reason, but does nothing after a
callback has been claimed or the job has reached a terminal state. All three
worker Lambdas use a 60-second timeout and their SQS queues use a 360-second
visibility timeout.

Runtime configuration is owned by the adapter:
`APIFY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `APIFY_ACTOR_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, the three
platform credentials and actor IDs, `APIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`, and
`APIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Terraform injects the API Gateway callback URL into the
workers. The shared Bearer credential belongs only in the runtime Secrets
Manager secret and must never be committed.

---

## YouTube

**Source type**: `youtube`
**Worker file**: `media_summarizer/workers/youtube_ingestion_worker.py`

### Only path (Apify, task-309)

| Provider/library | Identifier | Extracts | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apify | YouTube Transcript actor, id from `APIFY_YOUTUBE_TRANSCRIPT_ACTOR_ID` | Transcript text (flat field or timed segments), plus best-effort title / channel / thumbnail | `YOUTUBE_INGESTION_QUEUE`, `TRANSCRIPT_BUCKET`, `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE`, `APIFY_YOUTUBE_API_TOKEN`, `APIFY_YOUTUBE_TRANSCRIPT_ACTOR_ID` |

Workflow:
1. Extract `video_id` from the normalized URL
2. Start the actor run asynchronously via `apify_orchestration.start_run_for_job`, persisting the run and arming an SQS backstop; the invocation returns `mode="apify_pending"`
3. On the actor callback, fetch the terminal dataset and parse the configured actor's flat transcript field (see "Supported actor dialects")
4. Upload to S3 as `{job_id}.txt`, debit the flat captions unit (task-287), publish the success event with `strategy_used="apify_transcript"`

There is **no fallback chain**: no yt-dlp attempt, no Deepgram audio path. No
supported actor exposes a raw audio URL, so an actor failure is terminal.

Ref: `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::process_youtube_message`, `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::_start_apify_transcript_run`, `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::_parse_apify_transcript`

#### Why yt-dlp was removed

yt-dlp used to be the primary path with Apify as an IP-block fallback (task-177).
Measured on dev on 2026-08-20: 10 of 12 YouTube jobs succeeded via
`apify_youtube_transcript`, **zero** via yt-dlp, and every yt-dlp attempt logged
`Sign in to confirm you're not a bot`. The dead round-trip billed ~6.4 s per
invocation against ~1.6 s for pure-Apify ones, on every save. task-309 deleted
the branch rather than demoting it. task-310 then did the same for Instagram
(6/6 IP-blocked). The yt-dlp package remains in the image for the **TikTok
worker**, its last consumer, which still uses it successfully (2/2 saves via
`native_subtitles` on 2026-08-20).

Apify uses the dedicated `APIFY_YOUTUBE_API_TOKEN` credential and
`APIFY_YOUTUBE_TRANSCRIPT_ACTOR_ID`; both are read only by the shared adapter.

#### Supported actor dialects

The actor ID is **runtime configuration read from Secrets Manager**, so the code cannot assume which actor is in use: the Lambda bootstrap (`workers/lambda_handlers.py`) applies the secret with `os.environ.setdefault`, meaning the secret always wins over the code default. The worker therefore declares one input/output dialect per supported actor in `_APIFY_ACTOR_DIALECTS` and adapts both the payload and the parsing. Schemas verified live against the Apify build API on 2026-08-05:

| Actor | Input | Flat transcript field | `language` input | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `starvibe~youtube-video-transcript` | `{"youtube_url": "<url>", "include_transcript_text": true, "language": "<iso-639-1>"}` | `transcript_text` | Yes (`^[a-z]{2}$`) | Language-aware target of task-216. Reports the delivered language as a code (`"fr"`). $0.005/dataset item. |
| `scrape-creators~best-youtube-transcripts-scraper` | `{"videoUrls": ["<url>"]}` | `transcript_only_text` | No — only `videoUrls` is accepted | Currently deployed in `dev`. No language control possible; reports the delivered language as an English name (`"English"`). |

Sending `language` to an actor that does not declare it would be rejected as `invalid-input` (HTTP 400), so `_build_apify_transcript_payload` only adds it when the dialect sets `supports_language`. Response parsing (`_apify_item_transcript_text`) reads the dialect's flat transcript field, falling back to concatenating the `text` of each `transcript[]` segment. The delivered language goes through `resolve_language_code` (which maps both `"fr"` and `"English"` to a bare ISO 639-1 code) before being persisted in `transcription_metadata.language`, which is what the task-192 translation step consumes via `job_source_language_hint`.

An actor ID with no known dialect fails fast with `apify_actor_unsupported:<actor-id>` **before any HTTP call**, plus a `config.actor_unsupported` ERROR log naming the configured ID and the supported set — a misconfigured secret is diagnosable instead of surfacing as an opaque provider 400.

#### Rollout prerequisite — coordinated secret update required

> **The task-216 language control on the Apify path is inert until the runtime secret is switched.** As of 2026-08-05 the deployed `media-summarizer-runtime-dev` secret holds `APIFY_YOUTUBE_TRANSCRIPT_ACTOR_ID = "scrape-creators~best-youtube-transcripts-scraper"`, which has no `language` input. Deploying the code alone is safe (that actor is a supported dialect and keeps working exactly as before, just without language selection), but the user's `reading_language` will **not** reach the Apify fallback until an operator updates the secret.

To enable it, update `APIFY_YOUTUBE_TRANSCRIPT_ACTOR_ID` in the runtime secret
through the Secrets Manager console or the owner's controlled secret-update
workflow before, or atomically with, the deploy. Do not export the complete
runtime secret to a tracked file or paste it into task notes.

The Lambda picks the new value up on its next cold start (secrets are loaded once per cold start). `.env.example` documents the same value, and the supported actors, for a new environment — Terraform carries no secret values (task-221 §7.3). If an environment is left on `scrape-creators`, the worker emits a `transcription.language_request_unsupported` WARNING per affected job and records `extraction_metadata.language_supported=false`, so the gap is visible in logs rather than silent.

#### Failure details

Apify failure details are the `ApifyTranscriptFailure` enum (`apify_token_missing`, `apify_actor_missing`, `apify_actor_unsupported`, `apify_network`, `apify_payment_required`, `apify_auth_error`, `apify_server_error`, `apify_client_error`, `apify_invalid_json`, `apify_no_results`, `apify_invalid_result`, `apify_actor_error`, `apify_empty_transcript`, `apify_geo_restricted`, `apify_age_restricted`, `apify_video_unavailable`). They surface in `YouTubeIngestionError.details`, in `extraction_metadata.failure_details`, and in the failure event `reason` — treat them as an observability contract.

An actor item with `status="error"` is mapped to a specific failure by `_classify_actor_error`, which matches on a substring of `error_category`: `geo` / `region` / `country` → `apify_geo_restricted` (`youtube_geo_restricted`); `age` / `sign_in` / `login` → `apify_age_restricted` (`youtube_age_restricted`); `unavailable` / `private` / `deleted` / `removed` / `not_found` → `apify_video_unavailable` (`youtube_unavailable`); anything else → `apify_actor_error:<category>`. All four are terminal. `language_not_available` never reaches the classifier — the callback branch retries it on the video's default track first.

### Transcript language selection (task-216)

The target transcript language is **not** decided by the worker and there is no global default env var (`YOUTUBE_TRANSCRIPT_LANGUAGE` was removed). It is resolved by the API in `POST /api/media/ingest-url`:

1. explicit `transcript_language` in the request body (per-submission override), else
2. the authenticated user's `reading_language` preference (task-190), else
3. nothing — no language is sent to the provider.

The value is normalized to a bare lowercase ISO 639-1 code (`normalize_language_code` in `utils/language_codes.py`) and travels API → orchestrator → SQS `transcript_language` → worker. The worker reads it via `_requested_transcript_language` (which also accepts `language` / `locale` as weaker hints for non-API producers) and uses it on the Apify path:

- **Apify** (the only path): `language` is sent in the actor input **when the configured actor supports it**, so the actor returns that language's captions directly and no downstream translation LLM call is needed. See "Rollout prerequisite" above — this requires the runtime secret to name `starvibe~youtube-video-transcript`.

Three degradation levels on the Apify path, all of them non-fatal:

| Situation | Behaviour | Recorded as |
|---|---|---|
| Actor supports `language`, video has that language | Transcript returned directly in the target language | `language_supported=true`, `language_fallback=false` |
| Actor supports `language`, video does **not** have it (`status="error"`, `error_category="language_not_available"`) | Retry **once** without `language` to take the video's default track; `transcription.language_fallback` INFO log | `language_supported=true`, `language_fallback=true` |
| Configured actor has no `language` input at all (e.g. `scrape-creators`) | Request skipped, video default captions used; `transcription.language_request_unsupported` WARNING log naming the configured and language-aware actor IDs | `language_supported=false` |

In the last two cases the task-192 pipeline (detection + GPT-5-nano translation) brings the transcript to the user's `reading_language`. Requesting a language is therefore a cost optimisation (one saved LLM call), never a correctness requirement.

Verified live against the Apify API on 2026-08-05 with `starvibe~youtube-video-transcript`: EN video + `language=en` → `en`; same EN video + `language=fr` → real French track; FR video + `language=fr` → `fr`; ES video + `language=es` → `es`; ES video + `language=ja` → `language_not_available`, fallback to the default track. Omitting `language` on that ES video returns Catalan, which is why the language is always sent when known. The same EN video run through the deployed `scrape-creators` actor asking `fr` returns `en` with `language_supported=false`, confirming the degradation path.

Ref: `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::process_youtube_message`, `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::_start_apify_transcript_run`, `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::_parse_apify_transcript`, `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::_apify_actor_dialect`, `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::_build_apify_transcript_payload`, `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::_requested_transcript_language`, `utils/language_codes.py::resolve_language_code`

### Terminal failure mode

- `YouTubeIngestionError` after max retries (`YOUTUBE_WORKER_MAX_RETRIES`, default 3)
- Mark job failed (`error_step="youtube_ingestion"`)
- Publish `episode_completion_status(status=failure)`
- User-facing `error_code` → observability `reason` (see [how a failure is written down](#cross-cutting-how-a-failure-is-written-down-task-359)); the `reason` values are `ApifyTranscriptFailure` members, unchanged:
  - `MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE` ← `missing_video_id`, `video_unavailable`, `actor_error`
  - `GEO_RESTRICTED` ← `geo_restricted` · `AGE_RESTRICTED` ← `age_restricted`
  - `PROVIDER_RESULT_INVALID` ← `no_results` · `NO_TRANSCRIPT_AVAILABLE` ← `empty_transcript`
  - `PROVIDER_CONFIG_ERROR` ← `actor_unsupported` (unset actor id / rejected token)
  - `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` ← `apify_run_not_succeeded` (retryable)
  - `INVALID_JOB_MESSAGE` ← `missing_job_id`, `missing_normalized_url`, `processing_job_not_found`, `apify_context_mismatch`
  - `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` ← `unexpected_exception`
- The actor's own `error_category` is not a code: it travels as `actor_error_category` inside `error_metadata`

Ref: `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::YouTubeIngestionError`, `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::ApifyTranscriptFailure`, `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::_classify_actor_error`

### Downstream dependencies

- Apify transcript success: `EPISODE_COMPLETION_EVENTS_QUEUE` env var, default queue `episode-completion-events` (inline)
- No Deepgram hand-off: the worker no longer enqueues `deepgram-transcription-queue` at all (task-309 removed the only path that produced an audio URL)

## Instagram Reel

**Source type**: `instagram-reel`
**Worker file**: `media_summarizer/workers/instagram_ingestion_worker.py`
**Resolver**: `media_summarizer/infrastructure/resolvers/instagram_apify_resolver.py::InstagramApifyResolver`

### Primary path

| Provider/library | Identifier | Extracts | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apify Instagram Reel Scraper | `apify~instagram-reel-scraper` (configurable via `APIFY_INSTAGRAM_REEL_ACTOR_ID`) | `audioUrl` (preferred) or `videoUrl`, `displayUrl`, caption, owner | `INSTAGRAM_INGESTION_QUEUE`, `APIFY_INSTAGRAM_API_TOKEN`, `APIFY_INSTAGRAM_REEL_ACTOR_ID` |

Apify is the **only** path since task-310. A yt-dlp attempt used to run first for free; measured on dev on 2026-08-20 it was IP-blocked on 6 attempts out of 6 (2026-08-18 → 2026-08-20) while all 10 Instagram jobs in `processing_jobs-dev` resolved through `apify~instagram-reel-scraper`. Every reel paid for that dead round-trip before Apify did the real work, so the branch was deleted rather than demoted.

Since task-274 the API never resolves Instagram inline: `POST /api/media/ingest-url` persists the job, enqueues `instagram-ingestion-queue` and returns. An Apify run measured at 63-100 s could not fit the 30 s ceiling API Gateway imposes on the request, so every save timed out with nothing persisted while the actor run was billed and thrown away. The API-side resolver (`adapters/resolvers.py::InstagramResolver`) only classifies.

Workflow:
1. `instagram_ingestion_worker` consumes `instagram-ingestion-queue` and marks the job `EXTRACTING`
2. `InstagramApifyResolver.resolve()` classifies the content type and immediately raises `InstagramApifyRequired` — reels, IGTV and posts alike. It never calls a provider
3. The worker starts the matching actor (Reel Scraper for reel/IGTV, Post Scraper for `/p/`), persists the run correlation and returns. On the callback continuation it feeds the terminal dataset to `resolve_apify_dataset(...)`, which picks `audioUrl` (preferred) or `videoUrl`
4. The worker hands the URL to the Deepgram queue with `deepgram_mode="push"` (Instagram CDNs block Deepgram's own fetch, so the Deepgram worker downloads the bytes and posts them), carrying the derived title (task-266) and `quota_source_platform="instagram"` so the minutes are not billed a second time as audio. **Nothing descriptive travels to Deepgram**: the caption stays on the job (see [where the author's description goes](#cross-cutting-where-the-authors-description-goes-task-383)). It used to be passed as `caption`/`comments`/`comments_count`, which the Deepgram worker never read — task-383 deleted those parameters

Ref: `instagram_apify_resolver.py::InstagramApifyResolver.resolve`, `instagram_apify_resolver.py::InstagramApifyResolver.resolve_apify_dataset`, `instagram_ingestion_worker.py::process_instagram_message`

### Fallback chain

There is **no fallback chain** for Instagram — a single provider, then a single handoff:

| Step | Trigger condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (only path) | The URL classifies as reel or IGTV | Start `apify~instagram-reel-scraper` (configurable via `APIFY_INSTAGRAM_REEL_ACTOR_ID`) with `{"username": [<url>], "resultsLimit": 1}`, persist the run and return. On callback, parse the dataset; the resolver picks `audioUrl` (preferred) or `videoUrl` (fallback) |
| 2 (Deepgram handoff) | Apify produced an `audio_url` | `enqueue_deepgram_transcription(..., deepgram_mode="push", source_platform="instagram", quota_source_platform="instagram")` |
| 3 (callback absent) | No terminal callback is claimed within 15 minutes | The delayed same-queue backstop marks the waiting job failed and publishes `apify_callback_deadline_exceeded` |

An actor failure is terminal: nothing else resolves Instagram, so the job fails with a user-readable reason rather than escalating. The `__e2e_force_ip_block__` sentinel no longer applies here — it existed to force the Apify branch while yt-dlp was primary, and TikTok is now its only consumer.

Ref: `instagram_apify_resolver.py::InstagramApifyResolver.resolve`, `instagram_apify_resolver.py::_resolve_reel`

### Terminal failure mode

- User-facing `error_code` → observability `reason` (see [how a failure is written down](#cross-cutting-how-a-failure-is-written-down-task-359)):
  - `NO_TRANSCRIBABLE_MEDIA` ← `resolver_non_retryable` (+`exception_type`), `no_transcript_or_audio_url`
  - `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` ← `resolver_retryable`, `apify_run_not_succeeded` (both retryable)
  - `PROVIDER_RESULT_INVALID` ← `apify_result_invalid`
  - `POST_TEXT_EMPTY` / `DOCUMENT_PARSE_FAILED` ← `instagram_image_post_no_text` (photo posts only: the first when the OCR ran and found no text and the post has no caption either, the second when the parsing chain itself failed on every image)
  - `INVALID_JOB_MESSAGE` ← `missing_job_id`, `missing_normalized_url`, `processing_job_not_found`
  - `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` ← `unexpected_exception`
- After max retries (`INSTAGRAM_WORKER_MAX_RETRIES`, default 3), the job is marked failed (`error_step="instagram_ingestion"`) and a failure event is published

Ref: `instagram_ingestion_worker.py::InstagramIngestionError`, `instagram_ingestion_worker.py::process_message`

### Downstream dependencies

- Apify produced an `audio_url`: `deepgram-transcription-queue` (`push`, then Deepgram publishes the completion event)
- All terminal errors: `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE` env var, default queue `episode-completed-events` (failure event)

## Instagram Post

**Source type**: `instagram-post`
**Worker file**: same `instagram_ingestion_worker.py` worker, distinct branch in `InstagramApifyResolver`

### Primary path

| Provider/library | Identifier | Extracts | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apify Instagram Post Scraper | `apify~instagram-post-scraper` (configurable via `APIFY_INSTAGRAM_POST_ACTOR_ID`) | Image URLs, caption, comments, post type (single / carousel / video-post) | `APIFY_INSTAGRAM_API_TOKEN`, `APIFY_INSTAGRAM_POST_ACTOR_ID` (read by the shared adapter) |
| LlamaParse, then Unstructured | see [Document](#document) — the chain lives in `core/services/document_parsing_service.py` and is shared with `document_parsing_worker` | The text printed inside each image of the post | `LLAMAPARSE_API_KEY`, `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` |

URL classification scans every path segment for a known indicator (`reel`, `p`, `tv`) so both `/p/<id>/` and `/<username>/p/<id>/` shapes resolve to the same content type.

Since task-384 a photo post is **read**, not refused: what a carousel of slides, a screenshot or an infographic carries is text, and the parsing chain the document worker already pays for reads exactly that. There is no separate worker and no new queue — the OCR happens inside the Instagram Apify callback invocation, which is why that Lambda has a 300 s timeout where the other resolvers have 60 s.

Workflow split inside the resolver:
- **URL path `/p/...` (image post or carousel)** → returns a `MediaType.IMAGE_POST` payload (image URLs + caption). The worker downloads each image *on the callback* (the CDN URLs are signed with `oh`/`oe` and expire within days, so they are never persisted for a later run), parses them through the shared chain, and writes one `## Image N` section per slide into the transcript. A single-image post gets its text with no heading at all.
- **URL path `/p/...` containing video** → currently treated as `IMAGE_POST` by the post scraper (the V1 pipeline does not split video posts from image posts; video posts surface only via `/reel/...` URLs).

Guards on the parsing loop, all in `instagram_ingestion_worker.py`: at most `INSTAGRAM_IMAGE_PARSE_MAX_IMAGES` (10) slides, a wall-clock budget of `INSTAGRAM_IMAGE_PARSE_BUDGET_SECONDS` (240 s) that stops the loop before the Lambda ceiling, a `INSTAGRAM_IMAGE_MAX_BYTES` (20 MB) cap per download, and each temporary file deleted right after it is parsed.

The job completes in place: transcript uploaded to `TRANSCRIPT_BUCKET` as `{job_id}.md` (the `.md` suffix is what makes `raw_content_service` leave the section headings alone), `set_transcription_metadata(provider=…, images_parsed=…, duration_seconds=0, source="instagram_image_ocr")`, `mark_completed`, then a success `episode_completion_status` event — the same shape `x_ingestion_worker` uses for a text-only post. `job.media_type` becomes `image_post`, which the detail endpoint maps to the canonical `MediaType.IMAGE_POST`.

Ref: `instagram_apify_resolver.py::_detect_instagram_content_type`, `instagram_apify_resolver.py::_resolve_post`, `instagram_ingestion_worker.py::_complete_image_post`, `core/services/document_parsing_service.py`

### Fallback chain

| Step | Trigger condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The post has images | Parse each one through LlamaParse, then Unstructured for that image if LlamaParse fails (the shared document chain) |
| 2 | No image yielded any text, but the post has a caption | The caption *becomes* the transcript body. The author's description is then omitted from the media detail (`source_description_in_transcript` on the job metadata) rather than shown twice |
| 3 | No text and no caption | Terminal failure — there is nothing to summarise |

The caption is never concatenated to the OCR text: when the images speak, they are the document; the caption stays where task-383 put it, in `resolver_metadata`, and is served as the author's description.

Only the user's minutes are debited, once per job, through `record_document_consumption` in the shared service (1 minute per 5 pages, same rate as an uploaded document) plus the LlamaParse pool counter keyed on `llamaparse:<job_id>`. No quota *gate* is added here: `check_submission_allowed` already ran at submission, and refusing a job halfway through its own ingestion would leave the user with a failure they cannot act on.

### Terminal failure mode

Provider failures from the post-scraper actor (auth, quota, run not succeeded) use the same `InstagramIngestionError` taxonomy as Reels: `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` / `PROVIDER_RESULT_INVALID`. The two failures specific to a photo post, both written with `reason="instagram_image_post_no_text"`:

- `POST_TEXT_EMPTY` — every image was parsed successfully and none contained text, and the post has no caption either. The post is pictures without words; nothing is broken.
- `DOCUMENT_PARSE_FAILED` — the parsing chain itself did not get to read the images: a download failed, both providers errored, or the budget ran out before any slide was parsed.

### Downstream dependencies

- A parsed post → no transcription queue: the job is completed in place by the Instagram worker, exactly as an X post is. `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE` receives the success event, which is what gets the media indexed for search, its `review_blurb` generated and any artifact waiting on it resumed (`workers/events/media_completed_worker.py`)
- Errors → `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE` env var, default queue `episode-completed-events` (failure event)

## TikTok

**Source type**: `tiktok`
**Worker file**: `media_summarizer/workers/tiktok_ingestion_worker.py`

### Primary path

| Provider/library | Identifier | Extracts | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| yt-dlp | `yt_dlp.YoutubeDL` with `writesubtitles=True`, `subtitleslangs=["all"]` | Native subtitle text (VTT / SRT / JSON) from TikTok CDN | `TIKTOK_INGESTION_QUEUE`, `YTDLP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `TIKTOK_SUBTITLE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `TIKTOK_WORKER_MAX_RETRIES` (rate limiter via `tiktok_limiter`) |

Workflow:
1. `tiktok_ingestion_worker` consumes `tiktok-ingestion-queue` and marks the job `EXTRACTING`
2. Strip the `__e2e_force_ip_block__` sentinel via `strip_e2e_force_ip_block_sentinel(...)` (skips yt-dlp and goes straight to Apify when present)
3. Acquire a rate-limit slot via `tiktok_limiter.acquire_tiktok_slot()`
4. Run `yt_dlp.YoutubeDL.extract_info(url, download=False)` with subtitle options
5. Collect `requested_subtitles` + `subtitles` candidates, fetch and parse the best-priority one
6. Upload transcript to S3 as `{job_id}.txt`

Ref: `tiktok_ingestion_worker.py::_extract_tiktok_info`, `tiktok_ingestion_worker.py::_fetch_native_subtitles`, `tiktok_ingestion_worker.py::_parse_caption_payload`, `utils/ingestion_sentinels.py::strip_e2e_force_ip_block_sentinel`

### Fallback chain

| Step | Trigger condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | yt-dlp raises with TikTok status `10204` / `"IP address is blocked"` (`_looks_like_ip_blocked_error`), OR sentinel forces it | Start the Apify TikTok Transcript actor asynchronously with `{"videos": [<url>]}`, persist the run and return. The callback continuation parses the WEBVTT `transcript` field via `_parse_timed_text_payload` and uploads it (`strategy_used="apify_native_transcript"`) |
| 2 | yt-dlp succeeded but `NativeSubtitlesUnavailable` (no captions on the video) | Resolve direct media URL from yt-dlp `info` via `_resolve_direct_media_url`, hand off via `enqueue_deepgram_transcription` with `deepgram_mode="pull_with_push_fallback"` (`strategy_used` from `_build_fallback_extraction_metadata`) |

When the Apify actor returns `success=false` or no transcript, the job fails terminally — the new actor does not expose a media URL, so there is no chained Deepgram path from the IP-block branch.

The IP-block matcher accepts both the legacy `10204` token and the modern phrasings (`ip address is blocked`, `ip block`, `geo block`). It does NOT match geo restrictions, deleted videos, rate limits, or generic yt-dlp errors — those propagate as terminal `extractor_failed` / `unsupported_content`.

E2E test seam: a sentinel query param `__e2e_force_ip_block__=1` forces the Apify branch. The shared helper lives in `utils/ingestion_sentinels.py`.

Apify uses the dedicated `APIFY_TIKTOK_API_TOKEN` credential and
`APIFY_TIKTOK_TRANSCRIPT_ACTOR_ID`; both are read only by the shared adapter.

### Terminal failure mode

- `TikTokIngestionError` after max retries (`TIKTOK_WORKER_MAX_RETRIES`, default 3)
- User-facing `error_code` → observability `reason` (see [how a failure is written down](#cross-cutting-how-a-failure-is-written-down-task-359)):
  - `MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE` ← `missing_tiktok_id`, `yt_dlp_media_unavailable` (private / deleted)
  - `LIVE_CONTENT_UNSUPPORTED` ← `live_content_not_supported`
  - `NO_TRANSCRIBABLE_MEDIA` ← `no_transcribable_media_url`, `missing_media_url`
  - `NO_TRANSCRIPT_AVAILABLE` ← `apify_no_transcript` (actor ran, returned nothing usable)
  - `PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITED` ← `tiktok_limiter_exhausted`, `yt_dlp_rate_limited` (retryable)
  - `PROVIDER_TIMED_OUT` ← `yt_dlp_timeout` (retryable)
  - `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` ← `yt_dlp_failed`, `subtitle_fetch_failed`, `subtitle_http_error` (+`http_status`), `apify_run_not_succeeded`

  - `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` ← `unexpected_exception`

### Downstream dependencies

- Native subtitle success: `EPISODE_COMPLETION_EVENTS_QUEUE` env var, default `episode-completion-events` (inline)
- Apify transcript fallback success: `EPISODE_COMPLETION_EVENTS_QUEUE` (inline)
- yt-dlp succeeded + no captions: `deepgram-transcription-queue` (`pull_with_push_fallback`, then Deepgram publishes the completion event)

## X (Twitter)

**Source type**: `x`
**Worker file**: `media_summarizer/workers/x_ingestion_worker.py`

### Primary path

| Provider/library | Identifier | Extracts | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| X API v2 | `GET /tweets/{tweet_id}` with `tweet.fields=...,note_tweet` and `expansions=author_id` | Tweet text (preferring `note_tweet.text` for long-form), author username/name | `X_API_BEARER_TOKEN`, `X_API_BASE_URL`, `X_API_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `X_INGESTION_QUEUE`, `X_WORKER_MAX_RETRIES` |

Workflow:
1. Receive message with pre-extracted `tweet_id` (set by `XPostResolver` upstream)
2. Mark job `EXTRACTING` (post task-175)
3. Call X API v2 lookup endpoint, prefer `note_tweet.text` then fall back to `data.text`
4. Upload text to S3 as `{job_id}.txt`
5. Set `podcast_title = "X - @<username>"`, `episode_title` = first line truncated to 120 chars

Ref: `x_ingestion_worker.py::_lookup_post`, `x_ingestion_worker.py::process_x_message`

### Fallback chain

No fallback — failure is terminal. Single provider (X API v2). Video tweets are not handled in V1 (only text content is extracted).

### Terminal failure mode

- `XIngestionError` after max retries (`X_WORKER_MAX_RETRIES`, default 3)
- User-facing `error_code` → observability `reason` (see [how a failure is written down](#cross-cutting-how-a-failure-is-written-down-task-359)); the HTTP status is in `error_metadata`, not in the reason token:
  - `MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE` ← `x_lookup_not_found` (404), `x_lookup_forbidden` (403)
  - `POST_TEXT_EMPTY` ← `x_post_text_empty`
  - `PROVIDER_AUTH_FAILED` ← `x_lookup_auth_failed` (401) · `PROVIDER_CREDITS_DEPLETED` ← `x_lookup_credits_depleted` (402)
  - `PROVIDER_CONFIG_ERROR` ← `missing_bearer_token`
  - `PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITED` ← `x_lookup_rate_limited` (429, retryable)
  - `PROVIDER_TIMED_OUT` ← `x_lookup_timeout` (retryable)
  - `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` ← `x_lookup_server_error` (5xx, retryable), `x_lookup_transport_error` (retryable), `x_lookup_client_error`
  - `PROVIDER_RESULT_INVALID` ← `x_lookup_missing_data`
  - `INVALID_JOB_MESSAGE` ← `missing_job_id`, `missing_normalized_url`, `missing_tweet_id`, `processing_job_not_found`
  - `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` ← `unexpected_exception`

Ref: `x_ingestion_worker.py::_mark_job_failed`, `x_ingestion_worker.py::XIngestionError`

### Downstream dependencies

Publishes to `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE`. Never enqueues to Deepgram.

## Document

**Source type**: `document`
**Worker file**: `media_summarizer/workers/document_parsing/worker.py`

### Primary path

| Provider/library | Identifier | Extracts | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| LlamaParse (cloud API) | `LlamaParseResolver` via `https://api.cloud.llamaindex.ai/api/parsing` | Structured markdown from PDF / DOCX / PPTX / XLSX / images (with OCR) | `LLAMAPARSE_API_KEY`, `LLAMAPARSE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `LLAMAPARSE_POLL_INTERVAL`, `LLAMAPARSE_MAX_POLLS`, `DOCUMENT_BUCKET`, `TRANSCRIPT_BUCKET`, `DOCUMENT_PARSING_QUEUE`, `DOCUMENT_PARSING_VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT` |
| (none) | `PlainTextResolver` | TXT / MD / RTF, decoded in-process — the file already *is* its text (task-380) | none |

**The chain is not owned by this worker.** Since task-384 `parse_document_with_fallback`
and the metering that follows it live in `core/services/document_parsing_service.py`,
because the Instagram photo-post branch parses images through the very same chain and
a worker importing another worker would be the wrong dependency edge. The worker keeps
what is specific to an uploaded file: the S3 download, the page render for the cover,
the transcript upload.

**The text formats never reach a provider.** `parse_document_with_fallback` routes
`TEXT_FORMATS` to `PlainTextResolver` before LlamaParse is called, so there is no
primary/fallback pair for them: nothing a second provider could read better than
the bytes themselves. They also report `page_count: 0`, which is what
`record_document_consumption` reads to charge zero minutes instead of rounding up
to the single page every other format has.

Workflow:
1. Download document from `DOCUMENT_BUCKET` (S3) to a temp file
2. Detect format from file extension via `DocumentFormat.from_extension()`
3. Mark job `EXTRACTING` (post task-175 — historically `mark_transcribing`)
4. Upload to LlamaParse, poll for job completion, retrieve markdown result
5. Upload markdown to `TRANSCRIPT_BUCKET` as `{job_id}.md`

E2E test seam: Upload a file with a filename starting with `__e2e_force_llamaparse_failure__` (e.g. `__e2e_force_llamaparse_failure__sample.pdf`) to trigger a simulated rate-limit error in `LlamaParseResolver.parse`, exercising the fallback in E2E tests. This approach avoids Lambda env-var propagation delays and requires no IAM permissions.

Ref: `core/services/document_parsing_service.py::parse_document_with_fallback`, `infrastructure/resolvers/llamaparse_resolver.py::LlamaParseResolver.parse`

### Fallback chain

| Step | Trigger condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | LlamaParse returns ANY `ParseError` (rate limit, timeout, API error, auth error, network error) | Fall back to Unstructured API |

Ref: `core/services/document_parsing_service.py::parse_document_with_fallback`

**Fallback provider:**

| Provider/library | Identifier | Extracts | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unstructured API (cloud) | `UnstructuredResolver` via `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general` | Structured elements rendered to markdown | `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY`, `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL`, `UNSTRUCTURED_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` |

Ref: `infrastructure/resolvers/unstructured_resolver.py::UnstructuredResolver`

### Terminal failure mode

- Both LlamaParse and Unstructured fail → `ParseError` with combined message (`provider="llamaparse+unstructured"`)
- Mark job failed (`error_code=DOCUMENT_PARSE_FAILED`, `error_step="document_parsing"`, `error_metadata` carrying the parser's `reason` code and the `document_format`). The provider's own wording stays in the raised `RuntimeError`, i.e. in CloudWatch, and is never persisted.
- Worker raises `RuntimeError` to trigger SQS retry / DLQ
- After max retries (3): job stays failed

Ref: `document_parsing/worker.py::process_document_parsing_message` (lines 230–235)

### Downstream dependencies

- `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE` (success event with `provider` set to the resolver that succeeded)
- `SEARCH_INDEXING_QUEUE` (best-effort search index update)

## Audio (direct URL / upload)

**Source type**: `audio`
**Worker files**:
- `POST /api/media/ingest-url` with `.mp3`/`.m4a`/etc. → `media_summarizer/api/endpoints/media.py:355` enqueues to `deepgram-transcription-queue` directly
- `POST /api/media/upload-audio` (file upload) → S3 staging then enqueue to Deepgram with a pre-signed URL
- `POST /api/podcasts/submit` (user-pasted audio URL) → `media_summarizer/api/endpoints/podcasts.py:255` enqueues to Deepgram
- All consume `media_summarizer/workers/transcription/deepgram_worker.py`

### Primary path

| Provider/library | Identifier | Extracts | Key env vars |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deepgram | `nova-3` model via `https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen` | Full transcript text | `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_URL`, `DEEPGRAM_MODEL`, `DEEPGRAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `DEEPGRAM_TRANSCRIPTION_QUEUE`, `AUDIO_BUCKET`, `TRANSCRIPT_BUCKET` |

Two input modes:
- **Pull mode** (`audio_url`): Deepgram fetches the audio URL itself (`call_deepgram_api`)
- **Push mode** (`audio_s3_key` or downloaded bytes): worker downloads, POSTs raw bytes (`call_deepgram_api_from_bytes`)

Workflow:
1. Worker reads `audio_url` and `audio_s3_key` from the message (and falls back to job state if missing)
2. Reads explicit `deepgram_mode` from the message body, validates against `VALID_DEEPGRAM_MODES = ("pull", "push", "pull_with_push_fallback")`
3. Marks job `TRANSCRIBING`
4. If `audio_s3_key` present → always push (download from S3, post bytes)
5. Else dispatch on `deepgram_mode` (see [Deepgram Modes](#cross-cutting-deepgram-modes))
6. Upload transcript to S3 as `{job_id}.txt`, publish success event with minutes-used computed from `audio_duration_seconds`

Ref: `transcription/deepgram_worker.py::process_deepgram_message`, `transcription/deepgram_worker.py::call_deepgram_api`, `transcription/deepgram_worker.py::call_deepgram_api_from_bytes`

### Fallback chain

Built into Deepgram mode dispatch (only `pull_with_push_fallback` falls back automatically; `pull` and `push` modes do not).

### Terminal failure mode

- `NonRetryableDeepgramError`: immediately publishes failure event (no retry)
  - Causes: empty API key, invalid `audio_url`, RSS/feed URL passed by mistake, empty transcript, HTTP 400/401/403/404/415/422, `RemoteContentError` when producer declared `pull` mode (producer misrouted)
- `RetryableDeepgramError` after max retries (3): publishes failure event
  - Causes: HTTP 429 / 5xx, timeout, transport error
- Test flag: `FORCE_DEEPGRAM_PUSH_MODE=1` simulates a `RemoteContentError` on `pull_with_push_fallback` to exercise the push fallback in E2E

Ref: `transcription/deepgram_worker.py::NonRetryableDeepgramError`, `transcription/deepgram_worker.py::RetryableDeepgramError`, `transcription/deepgram_worker.py::RemoteContentError`

### Downstream dependencies

Publishes to `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE` (terminates inline with success/failure event).

## RSS Feed Polling

**Source type**: feed-derived items (audio enclosure or article link)
**Worker file**: `media_summarizer/workers/rss_feed_poll_worker.py`

The RSS poll worker is the only producer that bypasses the URL classifier — it knows the item type from the feed metadata and routes directly:

| Item type | Target queue | `deepgram_mode` |
|---|---|---|
| Audio enclosure (`item_type=audio` + `audio_url`) | `deepgram-transcription-queue` | `pull` |
| Article (`item_type=article` or no audio URL) | `article-extraction-queue` | n/a |

Self-scheduling: the worker re-enqueues a poll trigger every `RSS_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 3600s, capped at the SQS max delay of 900s per message).

Ref: `rss_feed_poll_worker.py::_route_item_to_pipeline`, `rss_feed_poll_worker.py::_schedule_next_poll`

## Cross-cutting: Transcript Language Detection & Translation

A single, **source-agnostic** detect+translate step serves **every** source —
YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, audio/podcast (Deepgram), article, image OCR, document
(PDF/DOCX/PPTX), text file (TXT/MD/RTF), X, shared notes, and any future source. It
is **not** wired per source: all transcripts converge on
`ProcessingJob.transcription_s3_key`, so one insertion point covers the whole
matrix.

**What it is for (task-398): the reader's full text, and nothing else.** Only
`GET /api/media/{id}/raw-content` asks for a translated transcript, lazily, on
first open (cache miss → atomic reservation → SQS enqueue → async worker), and it
answers with the original text while the translation runs. **Artifact generation
does not come through here.** Each generator reads the source's *original*
transcript and is told the output language through `parameters["language"]` (the
requester's reading language) and `corpus.language_instruction`, so an artifact
asked for on a freshly ingested foreign media starts immediately instead of
waiting 60-90 s for a full transcript translation.

**Note (task-203):** the synchronous `prewarm_translated_transcript()` call that
previously ran in every ingestion worker before `job.mark_completed()` was
**removed**, which eliminated the 45 s blocking timeout wasted on every long
transcript. The `persist_detected_language()` side-effect moved into the async
translation worker, and the artifact resolver detects the language locally for its
corpus header.

### Pipeline position

```
[any source worker] -> transcript in S3 (job.transcription_s3_key)
        |
        +--> GET /api/media/{id}/raw-content   (reader, task-398 unaffected)
        |        1. detect language
        |        2. decide translation
        |        3. reserve + enqueue [transcript-translation-queue]
        |        4. worker translates (GPT-5-nano) -> translated transcript in S3
        |
        +--> POST /api/artifacts                (generation)
                 reads the ORIGINAL transcript; the reading language travels in
                 parameters["language"] -> [artifact-generator-queue]
```

### Step behavior

| Phase | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Detect** | Prefer a reliable source tag when present (Deepgram `detected_language` / forced `language` stored in `transcription_metadata`, YouTube subtitle language, `<podcast:transcript language>`). Otherwise classify the text locally with **`langdetect`** (free, deterministic via `DetectorFactory.seed=0`). Persists `detected_language` (ISO 639-1) on `transcription_metadata`. |
| **Decide** | Translate only when `detected_language != reading_language` (user preference from task-190) **and** the target is one of the 11 V1 languages (task-189: FR, EN, ES, DE, IT, PT, NL, JA, ZH, AR, HI). |
| **Translate** | `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` via the existing OpenAI stack (task-189 owner decision). System prompt preserves oral register, paragraphs, timestamps and speaker labels. **No chunking** for V1 (400k-token window). |
| **Persist** | Translated transcript written to the same `TRANSCRIPT_BUCKET` under a deterministic key `…​.translated.<target>.<ext>` with S3 metadata `is-translated`, `translated-from`, `target-language`. |
| **Downstream** | Only the reader: `/raw-content` serves the translated key once it exists. Artifact generation never reads it — it reads the original transcript and gets its output language from `parameters["language"]` (task-398). |

### Detection method choice (justification)

Local `langdetect` is preferred over an LLM-based detection prompt because the most
common path is "content already in the user's language" — local detection keeps that
path **zero-cost** and reserves the paid GPT-5-nano call for transcripts that genuinely
need translating. This matches the task-189 benchmark's explicit guidance.

### Idempotence

The translation cache key is `(transcript_s3_key, target_language)`, materialized as the
deterministic translated S3 key. Before translating, the step checks
`s3.object_exists(...)`; an existing object is reused and never re-translated.
Artifact idempotence is independent of it: `artifact_id` hashes the original
transcript's sources plus `parameters` (reading language included).

### Observability

`translation.completed` / `translation.skipped` / `translation.cache_hit` /
`translation.failed` structured logs carry: `source`, `detected_language`,
`target_language`, `detection_method` (`source_tag` | `langdetect` | `unknown`),
`model`, `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` / `total_tokens`, `duration_ms`,
`estimated_cost_usd`, and `translated` (bool).

### Failure handling

Translation is retried with exponential backoff (`TRANSLATION_MAX_RETRIES`, default 3).
On terminal failure the lock records the failure kind and `/raw-content` keeps
serving the original transcript, which the transcript reader surfaces as a
"Translation unavailable" badge. Nothing else is affected: no artifact waits on a
translation, so a refused one fails nothing but itself (task-398).

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TRANSLATION_LLM_MODEL` | `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` | Translation model (task-189). |
| `TRANSLATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `180` | Per-call timeout. |
| `TRANSLATION_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Retry attempts before fallback. |
| `TRANSLATION_BACKOFF_BASE_SECONDS` | `1.0` | Exponential backoff base. |

Ref: `core/services/transcript_translation.py::ensure_translated_transcript`,
`core/services/raw_content_service.py` (the only caller that asks for a
translation), `core/services/artifact_service.py::resolve_source` (reads the
original transcript, detects its language for the corpus header).

## Transcript Translation Worker (task-200, task-203)

**Worker file**: `media_summarizer/workers/transcript_translation_worker.py`
**Queue**: `transcript-translation-queue` (`visibility_timeout_seconds=600`, `maxReceiveCount=3`, DLQ: `transcript-translation-dlq`)
**Lambda handler**: `media_summarizer.workers.lambda_handlers.transcript_translation_handler`
**Lambda config**: `memory_size=512`, `timeout=300`

### Purpose

**The sole path for transcript translation** (task-203 removed the blocking prewarm
from ingestion workers). When the mobile client calls `/raw-content` and no cached
translation exists, the endpoint reserves a translation slot via the state machine
(DynamoDB) and enqueues a job to this worker. The worker translates the transcript
asynchronously (no API Gateway timeout constraint).

### Translation State Machine (task-203)

Translation idempotence is enforced via a dedicated DynamoDB table
(`translation_idempotence`) with the following state lifecycle:

```
(none) --> queued --> in_progress --> done
                         |
                         +--> failed (re-authorizes future reserve)
```

**Table**: `translation_idempotence` (hash key: `translation_fingerprint`)
**Fingerprint**: SHA-256 of `{transcript_s3_key}::{target_language}`
**Module**: `media_summarizer/utils/translation_idempotence.py`

| Operation | Who | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `reserve_translation()` | `/raw-content` endpoint | Atomically creates `queued` record (ConditionExpression: `attribute_not_exists OR status=failed`). Only the first caller wins. |
| `mark_translation_in_progress()` | Translation worker (on start) | `queued -> in_progress` |
| `mark_translation_done()` | Translation worker (on success) | `-> done` |
| `mark_translation_failed()` | Translation worker (on terminal failure) | `-> failed` (allows retry on next access) |

This eliminates the thundering herd bug where N concurrent `/raw-content` polls
each enqueued a separate translation job.

### Message schema

```json
{
  "transcript_s3_key": "string (required) -- S3 key of the original transcript",
  "target_language": "string (required) -- ISO 639-1 target language",
  "source_language_hint": "string|null -- reliable source-provided language tag",
  "source": "string|null -- source platform name for logging",
  "job_id": "string|null -- processing job ID for persist_detected_language"
}
```

### Behavior

1. Marks translation state `queued -> in_progress`.
2. Downloads the original transcript from S3 (`TRANSCRIPT_BUCKET`).
3. Calls `ensure_translated_transcript(...)` -- this function is fully idempotent
   (checks `s3.object_exists` for the translated key before doing any LLM work).
4. On success: marks state `-> done` and persists `detected_language` on the job
   (moved here from the removed prewarm, AC#2).
5. On terminal failure (`TranscriptTranslationError` after retries exhausted):
   marks state `-> failed`. Does NOT re-raise (prevents SQS retry of an already-
   exhausted attempt).
6. On unexpected error: marks state `-> failed` and re-raises (SQS may retry via
   visibility timeout, but the state machine ensures no thundering herd).

### `/raw-content` contract (task-200, updated task-203)

The `GET /api/media/:id/raw-content` endpoint **never** calls LLM translation
synchronously. Its behavior:

| Scenario | Response | `translation` metadata |
|---|---|---|
| No `reading_language` on user | Original content | `null` |
| Same language (no translation needed) | Original content | `{is_translated: false, translation_pending: false, translation_status: null, ...}` |
| Cached translation exists in S3 | Translated content | `{is_translated: true, translation_pending: false, translation_status: "done", ...}` |
| Translation queued/in_progress | **Original content** (immediate) | `{is_translated: false, translation_pending: true, translation_status: "queued"\|"in_progress", ...}` |
| Translation failed | **Original content** | `{is_translated: false, translation_pending: true, translation_status: "queued", ...}` (re-attempts reservation) |

When the client receives `translation_pending: true`, it displays the original
content immediately and polls `/raw-content` every ~3 seconds until either:
- `translation_pending: false` (translation done), or
- `translation_status: "failed"` (stop polling, show failure badge).

The translation worker typically completes within 10-90 seconds depending on
transcript length.

### Observability

Structured logs:
- `worker.translation_started` -- worker begins processing (status: in_progress)
- `worker.translation_completed` -- success (includes `detected_language`, `target_language`, `is_translated`, `duration_ms`)
- `worker.translation_terminal_failure` -- retries exhausted (status: failed)
- `worker.translation_unexpected_error` -- unexpected error (status: failed)
- `worker.s3_download_failed` -- transcript download failed (status: failed)
- `worker.invalid_message` -- missing required fields (not retried, no state change)
- `worker.empty_transcript` -- empty transcript file (status: done, nothing to translate)
- `worker.persist_language_failed` -- non-fatal: detected language not persisted on job

State machine logs (from `translation_idempotence.py`):
- `translation_idempotence.reserved` -- reservation acquired by caller
- `translation_idempotence.already_reserved` -- reservation rejected (another caller won)
- `translation_idempotence.failed` -- terminal failure recorded

Additionally, `ensure_translated_transcript` logs `translation.completed` / `translation.cache_hit` / `translation.failed` with full cost and token metrics.

### Env vars

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TRANSCRIPT_TRANSLATION_QUEUE` | `transcript-translation-queue` | SQS queue name. |
| `TRANSCRIPT_BUCKET` | `media-summarizer-transcripts` | S3 bucket for transcripts. |
| `TRANSLATION_LLM_MODEL` | `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07` | LLM model. |
| `TRANSLATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `180` | Per-LLM-call timeout (shared). |
| `TRANSLATION_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Retry attempts within the worker (shared). |
| `TRANSLATION_IDEMPOTENCE_TABLE` | `translation_idempotence` | DynamoDB table for state machine (task-203). |

## Cross-cutting: How a failure is written down (task-359)

A worker that gives up writes **two separate things**, and confusing them is the
defect task-359 fixed (an English sentence reached an `fr-FR` screen).

| What | Where it lands | Who reads it | Vocabulary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `error_code` | `ProcessingJob.error_code`, served by `GET /api/media/{id}` | the **app**, which renders a sentence in the reader's language | `MediaFailureCode` — `media_summarizer/core/models/failure_codes.py` |
| `reason` + context | `ProcessingJob.error_metadata`, served only by the operational `GET /jobs/{id}` | **us**, when debugging | free-form lower-snake tokens, per worker |
| the provider's own wording | CloudWatch, via `exc_info` on the terminal `log_event` | **us** | whatever the provider said |

No worker builds a user-facing sentence any more, and no free-text sentence is
persisted. `media_summarizer/utils/user_facing_errors.py` — which used to
pattern-match `str(e)` in `base_worker.py` to *guess* a friendly English line — is
deleted; an unclaimed exception is now `UNEXPECTED_ERROR`, full stop.

Every ingestion worker raises a thin subclass of `IngestionFailure`
(`media_summarizer/workers/ingestion_failures.py`):

```python
raise XIngestionError(
    MediaFailureCode.PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITED,
    details="x_lookup_rate_limited",   # the stable observability token
    retryable=True,
    http_status=429,                   # -> error_metadata, never in the code
)
```

The `details` token is the *old* per-worker error code, kept verbatim so log
queries and runbooks still work; it is what the per-worker "Terminal failure mode"
sections below list. Anything variable (an HTTP status, an Apify run id, a content
type, a duration) is a keyword argument and lands in `error_metadata` next to
`reason`, per AIP-193's rule that request-specific information belongs in metadata
"so that machine actors do not need to parse error messages".

Which `MediaFailureCode` each worker can emit:

| Worker | Codes |
|---|---|
| `article_extraction_worker.py` | `NOT_AN_ARTICLE_PAGE`, `ARTICLE_TEXT_NOT_FOUND`, `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `PROVIDER_TIMED_OUT`, `INVALID_JOB_MESSAGE`, `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` |
| `youtube_ingestion_worker.py` | `MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE`, `GEO_RESTRICTED`, `AGE_RESTRICTED`, `NO_TRANSCRIPT_AVAILABLE`, `PROVIDER_RESULT_INVALID`, `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `PROVIDER_CONFIG_ERROR`, `INVALID_JOB_MESSAGE`, `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` |
| `instagram_ingestion_worker.py` | `NO_TRANSCRIBABLE_MEDIA`, `POST_TEXT_EMPTY`, `DOCUMENT_PARSE_FAILED`, `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `PROVIDER_RESULT_INVALID`, `INVALID_JOB_MESSAGE`, `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` |
| `tiktok_ingestion_worker.py` | `MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE`, `LIVE_CONTENT_UNSUPPORTED`, `NO_TRANSCRIBABLE_MEDIA`, `NO_TRANSCRIPT_AVAILABLE`, `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITED`, `PROVIDER_TIMED_OUT`, `INVALID_JOB_MESSAGE`, `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` |
| `x_ingestion_worker.py` | `MEDIA_UNAVAILABLE`, `POST_TEXT_EMPTY`, `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`, `PROVIDER_RATE_LIMITED`, `PROVIDER_TIMED_OUT`, `PROVIDER_RESULT_INVALID`, `PROVIDER_AUTH_FAILED`, `PROVIDER_CREDITS_DEPLETED`, `PROVIDER_CONFIG_ERROR`, `INVALID_JOB_MESSAGE`, `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` |
| `document_parsing/worker.py` | `DOCUMENT_PARSE_FAILED` |
| `apify_orchestration.py` (callback backstop) | `PROVIDER_TIMED_OUT` |
| `core/services/audio_quota_gate.py` | `OUT_OF_MINUTES`, `ITEM_TOO_LONG` |
| `core/media_ingestion/adapters/orchestrators.py` | `SUBMISSION_FAILED` |

Adding a member to `MediaFailureCode` requires an entry in `ERROR_CODE_MESSAGES`
(`mobile/src/lib/getFriendlyErrorMessage.ts`) and a translated line in the eleven
catalogues under `mobile/src/i18n/` in the same commit — a code the app does not
know degrades to the generic failure line.

## Cross-cutting: Where the author's description goes (task-383)

Instagram, TikTok and YouTube each let the author write a text block next to the media — a caption, a clip caption, a video description. It is the only human-*written* material those platforms expose, and it often states what the audio never does. It has exactly one destination: the job's `extraction_metadata`, from where the artifact pipeline reads it back. No new DynamoDB attribute, no S3 object, and **no hand-off to Deepgram** — a transcription payload has no reader for it.

| Platform | Written by | Key on `extraction_metadata` | Absent when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Instagram reel / IGTV / post | `instagram_apify_resolver.py::_extract_caption` → `resolver_metadata` | `resolver_metadata.caption` | The actor returned no caption |
| TikTok (yt-dlp native subtitles, yt-dlp → Deepgram) | `tiktok_ingestion_worker.py::_build_native_extraction_metadata`, `::_build_fallback_extraction_metadata` from `info["description"]` | `source_description` | — |
| TikTok (Apify transcript fallback) | nobody | *(key absent)* | Always: that actor returns a transcript and no metadata at all |
| YouTube (Apify transcript) | `youtube_ingestion_worker.py::_build_apify_extraction_metadata` from `_APIFY_DESCRIPTION_FIELDS` | `source_description` | The actor returned none of the probed spellings — a tolerated miss, exactly like the title and the thumbnail |
| X (Twitter) | — | *(key absent)* | Always, and correctly: the tweet text **is** the transcript (`x_ingestion_worker.py`) |

Two spellings, one reader: `core/media_ingestion/source_description.py::job_source_description` is the only place that knows both. It strips the text, never truncates it, and returns `None` when the job carries none.

From there the value travels the path `published`/`captured` already traced: `ResolvedSource.description` (`artifact_service.py::resolve_source`) → the `description` key of `sources[]` in the generation message (`artifact_service.py::build_generation_message`) → the source dict of `artifact_generator/worker.py::_download_transcripts` → its own `--- author description ---` block in `artifact_generator/generators/corpus.py::build_corpus_block`, ahead of the transcript and never inside the `|`-joined header line. That covers the five user-requested artifact types **and** the automatic review blurb, which shares the same corpus builder.

Its bytes count twice over, in `ResolvedSource.byte_length` and in the worker's post-translation recount, so `MAX_FOLDER_CORPUS_TOKENS` measures what is really sent to the model. A missing description is never a failure: no retry, no error log, and the source simply carries no description block.

Ref: `core/media_ingestion/source_description.py`, `core/services/artifact_service.py::resolve_source`, `workers/artifact_generator/generators/corpus.py::build_corpus_block`, `workers/artifact_generator/generators/corpus.py::source_description_instruction`

---

## Cross-cutting: Deepgram Modes

Since task-158, each producer worker / endpoint declares an explicit `deepgram_mode` in the SQS message body sent to `deepgram-transcription-queue`. This eliminates wasted pull-attempt timeouts for sources where Deepgram cannot fetch audio directly (CDN IP-blocking).

The `media_summarizer/utils/deepgram_dispatch.py` helper centralises the SQS payload construction. All workers that hand off to Deepgram should call `enqueue_deepgram_transcription(...)` rather than building the message body inline — the helper enforces the canonical schema (`job_id`, `audio_url`, `deepgram_mode`, `source_platform`, ...) and prevents drift.

### Mode definitions

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `pull` | Deepgram fetches the URL itself. A `REMOTE_CONTENT_ERROR` from Deepgram fails loudly (producer misrouted). |
| `push` | Worker downloads audio bytes, POSTs them to Deepgram. Required for CDNs that block Deepgram IPs. |
| `pull_with_push_fallback` | Try pull first; on `RemoteContentError` fall back to push. |

### Producer-to-mode mapping

| Producer worker / call site | `deepgram_mode` | Source |
|---|---|---|
| YouTube ingestion worker (yt-dlp succeeded, no subtitles found) | `push` | `youtube_ingestion_worker.py` |
| TikTok ingestion worker (yt-dlp succeeded, no native captions) | `pull_with_push_fallback` | `tiktok_ingestion_worker.py` (via `enqueue_deepgram_transcription`) |
| Instagram ingestion worker (Apify produced an `audio_url`) | `push` | `instagram_ingestion_worker.py` (via `enqueue_deepgram_transcription`) |
| Orchestrator: `audio_s3_key` present (staged audio) | `pull` | `orchestrators.py` (`audio_s3_key` branch) |
| Orchestrator: generic `audio_url` fallback | `pull_with_push_fallback` | `orchestrators.py` (generic audio_url branch) |
| PodcastIndex resolution worker | `pull` | `podcastindex_resolution_worker.py` |
| RSS feed poll worker (audio item) | `pull` | `rss_feed_poll_worker.py` |
| `POST /api/podcasts/submit` (user-pasted audio URL) | `pull_with_push_fallback` | `api/endpoints/podcasts.py` |
| `POST /api/media/ingest-url` (audio source platform) | `pull_with_push_fallback` | `api/endpoints/media.py` |
| `POST /api/media/upload-audio` (S3 pre-signed URL) | `pull` | `api/endpoints/media.py` |

### Backward compatibility

Messages with no `deepgram_mode` field default to `pull` and trigger a `WARNING` log (`transcription.missing_deepgram_mode`) to flag missed call sites.

Ref: `transcription/deepgram_worker.py::VALID_DEEPGRAM_MODES`, `transcription/deepgram_worker.py::process_deepgram_message`, `utils/deepgram_dispatch.py::enqueue_deepgram_transcription`

### Known drift: completion-events queue name

Two env-var names exist in the codebase for what is logically the same downstream queue: `EPISODE_COMPLETION_EVENTS_QUEUE` (default queue `episode-completion-events`, used by TikTok / YouTube / PodcastIndex workers) and `EPISODE_COMPLETED_EVENTS_QUEUE` (default queue `episode-completed-events`, used by Article / Instagram / X / Document / Deepgram workers). In each environment one of the two values is set so that all producers actually publish to the same SQS queue, but the inconsistency is real and should be unified in a future cleanup task.

---

## Decision Tree: URL Classification and Routing

The `RuleBasedUrlClassifier` in `media_summarizer/core/media_ingestion/adapters/classifiers.py` deterministically routes every ingested URL to the appropriate queue.

### Classification table

| Host pattern | Path condition | MediaFamily | SourcePlatform | resolver_key | Target queue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `open.spotify.com` | `/episode/*` or `/show/*` | PODCAST | SPOTIFY | `podcast.default` | `podcastindex-resolution-queue` |
| `podcasts.apple.com` | contains `podcast` segment | PODCAST | APPLE_PODCASTS | `podcast.default` | `podcastindex-resolution-queue` |
| `*.deezer.com` | `/show/*` or `/episode/*` | PODCAST | DEEZER | `podcast.default` | `podcastindex-resolution-queue` |
| `*.rss`, `*.xml`, `feeds.*`, `rss.*`, path with `feed` segment | feed-like | PODCAST | RSS | `podcast.default` | `podcastindex-resolution-queue` |
| `youtube.com`, `youtu.be`, `m.*`, `music.*` | `/watch?v=`, `/shorts/`, `/live/`, `/embed/` | YOUTUBE | YOUTUBE | `youtube.default` | `youtube-ingestion-queue` |
| `instagram.com` | `/reel/*`, `/p/*`, `/tv/*` | SOCIAL_VIDEO | INSTAGRAM | `instagram.default` | `instagram-ingestion-queue` (every shape; the worker completes image posts in place, from the text of their images) |
| `x.com`, `twitter.com` | `/{user}/status/{id}`, `/i/status/{id}`, `/i/web/status/{id}` | ARTICLE | X | `x.default` | `x-ingestion-queue` |
| `tiktok.com`, `vm.tiktok.com` | `/@user/video/*` or `/t/*` | SOCIAL_VIDEO | TIKTOK | `tiktok.default` | `tiktok-ingestion-queue` |
| any | path ends with `.mp3/.m4a/.aac/.ogg/.wav/.flac/.opus` | AUDIO | DIRECT_URL | `audio.default` | `deepgram-transcription-queue` |
| any | an http(s) page that is none of the above → source type `web_article` | ARTICLE | WEB | `article.default` | **none** — read inline in the request (task-392) |

Which source type a URL *is* is not decided in this file: `classify_source_type`
in `core/services/media_identity.py` owns that, so the canonical-URL policy and
this routing table cannot disagree about a host. The classifier decides what the
pipeline *does* with a source type, and whether the path is one that platform
actually serves.

`article-extraction-queue` is still live, fed only by `rss_feed_poll_worker`.

Ref: `classifiers.py::RuleBasedUrlClassifier.classify`, `media_identity.py::classify_source_type`

### Artifact generation (unified worker — task-195)

All artifact generation (flashcards, notes, quiz, summary_short, summary_detailed) is handled by a single unified worker consuming one SQS queue (`artifact-generator-queue`). The worker dispatches to per-kind generators via a registry keyed on `MediaArtifactType`.

| Component | Path |
|---|---|
| Unified worker (shared S3 download, LLM call, retries, validation, status transitions) | `media_summarizer/workers/artifact_generator/worker.py` |
| Generator registry | `media_summarizer/workers/artifact_generator/generators/__init__.py` |
| FlashcardsGenerator (prompt + pydantic schema + structured outputs) | `media_summarizer/workers/artifact_generator/generators/flashcards.py` |
| NotesGenerator (prompt + pydantic schema) | `media_summarizer/workers/artifact_generator/generators/notes.py` |
| QuizGenerator (prompt + pydantic schema + structured outputs) | `media_summarizer/workers/artifact_generator/generators/quiz.py` |
| SummaryShortGenerator (prompt + pydantic schema) | `media_summarizer/workers/artifact_generator/generators/summary_short.py` |
| SummaryDetailedGenerator (prompt + pydantic schema) | `media_summarizer/workers/artifact_generator/generators/summary_detailed.py` |

**Models per artifact kind** (validated by task-72 benchmark):
- `flashcards`: `gpt-5.4-nano-2026-03-17`
- `notes`: `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`
- `quiz`: `gpt-5.4-nano-2026-03-17`
- `summary_short`: `gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07`
- `summary_detailed`: `gpt-5.4-nano-2026-03-17`

**Queue**: `artifact-generator-queue` (single queue for all 5 kinds, `visibility_timeout_seconds=1800`, `maxReceiveCount=3`, DLQ: `artifact-generator-dlq`)

**Producer**: `artifact_service.get_artifact_queue()` returns `artifact-generator-queue` for all `MediaArtifactType` values. Messages include `artifact_type` in the body to route to the correct generator.
