## API Latency

**Alarm:** `media-summarizer-api-latency-p95-breach`
**Severity:** High
**Threshold:** API Gateway p95 latency > `API_SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS` (default 3000ms) for 5 minutes

### Symptoms

- Users experiencing slow responses
- Timeout errors on mobile clients
- p95 latency climbing on the dashboard

### Investigation Steps

1. **Check API Gateway metrics:**
   - CloudWatch -> API Gateway -> Latency by route
   - Identify which route(s) are contributing to the high p95

2. **Check Lambda API duration:**
   ```
   CloudWatch -> Lambda -> media-summarizer-api -> Duration p95
   ```
   - If Lambda Duration is high, the bottleneck is in the application code
   - If API Gateway latency is high but Lambda is normal, check cold starts

3. **Check downstream dependencies:**
   - DynamoDB read/write latency (check ThrottledRequests)
   - SQS SendMessage latency

4. **Check for cold starts:**
   - CloudWatch Insights on `/aws/lambda/media-summarizer-api`:
     ```
     filter @type = "REPORT"
     | fields @duration, @initDuration
     | filter @initDuration > 0
     | stats count(*), avg(@initDuration) by bin(5m)
     ```

### First Response

- If cold start related: increase provisioned concurrency
- If DynamoDB throttled: switch to on-demand billing or increase provisioned capacity
- If specific route: check for N+1 queries or missing pagination
- If widespread: check if Lambda memory is undersized (increase to 512MB+)

### Escalation

- If persists >30 min: page backend on-call
- If caused by AWS service degradation: check AWS Health Dashboard

---

## API 5xx Rate

**Alarm:** `media-summarizer-api-5xx-rate-breach`
**Severity:** Critical
**Threshold:** 5xx / total requests > 1% over 5 minutes

### Symptoms

- Users receiving server error responses
- Mobile clients showing generic error messages
- `api.request_error` events with status >= 500 in API logs

### Investigation Steps

1. **Identify error patterns:**
   ```
   CloudWatch Insights on /aws/lambda/media-summarizer-api:
   fields @timestamp, path, method, status, error_type, error_code
   | filter status >= 500
   | sort @timestamp desc
   | limit 20
   ```

2. **Check if deployment related:**
   - Was there a recent deployment? Check Lambda version aliases
   - If yes: consider rollback to previous version

3. **Check dependencies:**
   - DynamoDB: SystemErrors, ThrottledRequests
   - SQS: check if queues are accessible
   - Secrets Manager: check if secrets can be fetched

4. **Check Lambda errors:**
   - Unhandled exceptions, out-of-memory, timeout

### First Response

- If post-deployment: rollback Lambda to previous version
- If dependency outage: check AWS Health Dashboard
- If code bug: identify and hotfix
- If auth-related: check JWT secret rotation status

### Escalation

- If 5xx rate > 10%: immediate escalation to backend team
- If AWS service outage: communicate to users via status page

---

## DLQ Messages

**Alarm:** `media-summarizer-dlq-{dlq-name}-non-empty`
**Severity:** Medium
**Threshold:** Any message in DLQ (>0) for 5 minutes

### Affected DLQs

| DLQ Name | Source Queue | Worker |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `podcastindex-resolution-dlq` | `podcastindex-resolution-queue` | Podcast resolution |
| `youtube-ingestion-dlq` | `youtube-ingestion-queue` | YouTube ingestion |
| `tiktok-ingestion-dlq` | `tiktok-ingestion-queue` | TikTok ingestion |
| `x-ingestion-dlq` | `x-ingestion-queue` | X (Twitter) ingestion |
| `audio-download-dlq` | `audio-download-queue` | Audio download |
| `deepgram-transcription-dlq` | `deepgram-transcription-queue` | Deepgram transcription |
| `article-extraction-dlq` | `article-extraction-queue` | Article extraction |
| `artifact-generator-dlq` | `artifact-generator-queue` | Artifact generation (flashcards, notes, quiz, summary_short, summary_detailed) |
| `episode-completed-dlq` | `episode-completed-events` | Episode completed fan-out |
| `push-notification-dlq` | `push-notification-queue` | Push notifications |
| `spotify-sync-dlq` | `spotify-sync-queue` | Spotify sync |

### Symptoms

- Messages that exhausted all retries (default: 3 attempts)
- Usually indicates a persistent bug or bad input data

### Investigation Steps

1. **Inspect DLQ messages:**
   ```bash
   aws sqs receive-message \
     --queue-url <DLQ_URL> \
     --max-number-of-messages 5 \
     --attribute-names All \
     --message-attribute-names All
   ```

2. **Correlate with job_id:**
   - Extract `job_id` from message body
   - Check `processing_jobs` DynamoDB table for error details
   - Check worker Lambda logs for the specific job_id

3. **Determine root cause:**
   - Bad input data (malformed URL, unsupported format)
   - Transient failure that persisted across all retries
   - Bug in worker code
   - External service consistently failing for specific inputs

### First Response

- Inspect first few messages to determine if systematic or isolated
- If isolated bad data: delete DLQ messages, mark jobs as failed
- If systematic: fix root cause, then replay messages

### Replay Procedure

Use the replay script (see [How to Recover a DLQ After a Fix](#how-to-recover-a-dlq-after-a-fix) for the full procedure):

```bash
./scripts/replay_dlq.sh <dlq-name>
```

### Escalation

- If DLQ grows continuously: likely a code bug; prioritize fix
- If >50 messages: create incident ticket

---

## How to Recover a DLQ After a Fix

This section describes the end-to-end procedure for replaying messages from a Dead Letter Queue after deploying a bugfix that resolves the root cause of the failures.

### Prerequisites

- The bugfix has been **deployed and verified** (e.g., the worker Lambda is updated and healthy).
- You have AWS CLI v2 (>= 2.12.0) installed with appropriate credentials.
- You have confirmed that the DLQ contains messages (check via `aws sqs get-queue-attributes` or the SQS console).

### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Confirm the fix is deployed:**
   Verify the relevant Lambda function is running the new code version:
   ```bash
   aws lambda get-function --function-name media-summarizer-<worker> \
     --query 'Configuration.LastModified'
   ```

2. **Inspect a sample of DLQ messages** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   aws sqs receive-message \
     --queue-url <DLQ_URL> \
     --max-number-of-messages 3 \
     --attribute-names All \
     --visibility-timeout 0
   ```
   Verify these messages match the class of failures you just fixed. If some messages are genuinely bad data (not recoverable), consider purging those individually before replaying.

3. **Run the replay script:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/replay_dlq.sh <dlq-name>
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/replay_dlq.sh summarization-dlq
   ./scripts/replay_dlq.sh podcastindex-resolution-dlq
   ```
   The script will:
   - Refuse to run if the DLQ is empty
   - Start a message move task (SQS `StartMessageMoveTask` API)
   - Poll and report progress until all messages are moved back to the source queue

4. **Monitor reprocessing:**
   After replay, watch:
   - The source queue's `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` (should decrease as the worker processes)
   - The worker Lambda's error rate and invocation count in CloudWatch
   - The DLQ's message count (should stay at 0; if it grows again, the fix is incomplete)

5. **Verify success:**
   ```bash
   aws sqs get-queue-attributes \
     --queue-url <DLQ_URL> \
     --attribute-names ApproximateNumberOfMessages \
     --query 'Attributes.ApproximateNumberOfMessages'
   ```
   Should return `"0"`.

### Important Notes

- **DLQ retention is 14 days** (matching source queues). You have up to 14 days from when a message entered the DLQ to replay it.
- **Do not replay before fixing the root cause** — messages will fail again and re-enter the DLQ (after exhausting retries), burning through the receive count unnecessarily.
- **Partial replay is not supported** by the `StartMessageMoveTask` API — it moves all messages. If you only want to replay a subset, use `receive-message` + `send-message` + `delete-message` manually.
- **All queues now have a DLQ** with `maxReceiveCount = 3`. A message that fails 3 times will land in the corresponding DLQ.

### Script Reference

| Script | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `replay_dlq.sh` | `scripts/replay_dlq.sh` | Replay all messages from a named DLQ to its source queue |

Run `./scripts/replay_dlq.sh --help` for the full list of available DLQs.

## Lambda Errors

**Alarm:** `media-summarizer-{worker}-lambda-error-rate`
**Severity:** High
**Threshold:** Error rate > 5% over 10 minutes (2 consecutive 5-min periods)

### What this alarm cannot see

`AWS/Lambda` `Errors` only counts invocations that ended in an unhandled
exception. The SQS handler factory (`media_summarizer/workers/lambda_handlers.py`)
catches the exception, appends the record to `batchItemFailures` and returns
normally, so **a worker whose every message fails still reports an error rate of
0%** — and the DLQ stays empty until `maxReceiveCount` is reached. That is exactly
what happened on 2026-09-01: 3 artifact generations and 25 translations failed,
`Errors` stayed at 0, every alarm stayed OK.

Treat this alarm as covering what happens *outside* the per-record `try/except`
(cold-start crash, timeout, out-of-memory kill, bad handler path) and nothing
else. For the outcome question — "is the worker doing its job?" — read the
outcome alarms instead: [LLM Generation Failures](#llm-generation-failures) for
the two LLM workers, [Archiver Failure](#archiver-failure) for the job archiver,
and `durable-media.md` for the library writes.

### Symptoms

- Lambda function returning errors
- Jobs failing without completing
- Increased DLQ depth

### Investigation Steps

1. **Check error pattern:**
   ```
   CloudWatch Insights on /aws/lambda/media-summarizer-{worker}:
   fields @timestamp, event, error_type, error_code, job_id
   | filter level = "ERROR"
   | sort @timestamp desc
   | limit 20
   ```

2. **Check Lambda execution errors:**
   - Timeouts (check Duration vs configured timeout)
   - Out of memory (check Max Memory Used in REPORT lines)
   - Permission errors (check IAM role)

3. **Worker-specific checks:**

   **podcastindex-resolution:** PodcastIndex API down, API key expired
   **youtube-ingestion:** Apify actor failing, actor id misconfigured in the runtime secret, credits exhausted
   **tiktok-ingestion:** Apify actor failing, rate limits
   **x-ingestion:** X API rate limits, bearer token expired
   **audio-download:** S3 permissions, source URL unreachable
   **deepgram-transcription:** Deepgram API down, quota exhausted
   **article-extraction:** Target site blocking, timeout
   **document-parsing:** LlamaParse + Unstructured both failing
   **summarization:** OpenAI API rate limit, content policy
   **flashcards:** OpenAI API errors
   **search-indexing:** Algolia API errors

### First Response

- If timeout: increase Lambda timeout or optimize code
- If memory: increase Lambda memory size
- If external API: check provider status page
- If permission: check IAM role policies

### Escalation

- If error rate > 20%: immediate page to backend on-call
- If caused by external provider outage: communicate ETA to users

---

## Lambda Throttles

**Alarm:** `media-summarizer-{worker}-lambda-throttled`
**Severity:** High
**Threshold:** Any throttle (>0) in 5 minutes

### Symptoms

- Lambda invocations being rejected
- SQS messages remaining visible (not being consumed)
- Increased queue depth without corresponding invocations

### Investigation Steps

1. **Check concurrency:**
   ```
   CloudWatch -> Lambda -> {function} -> ConcurrentExecutions
   ```
   - Compare with account-level concurrent execution limit (default: 1000)
   - Check if reserved concurrency is set too low

2. **Check account limits:**
   ```bash
   aws lambda get-account-settings
   ```

3. **Check if burst-related:**
   - Initial burst limit is 500-3000 depending on region
   - After burst, scaling rate is 500/minute

### First Response

- If reserved concurrency too low: increase it
- If account limit reached: request limit increase via AWS Support
- If burst-related: add SQS batching or increase batch window
- Consider: adjust SQS event source mapping `MaximumConcurrency`

### Escalation

- If persistent throttling: request AWS Lambda concurrency limit increase
- If multiple functions throttled: likely account-level limit hit

---

## Deepgram Error Rate

**Alarm:** `media-summarizer-deepgram-error-rate-breach`
**Severity:** High
**Threshold:** Deepgram error rate > 5% over 15 minutes

### Symptoms

- Transcription jobs failing
- `worker.transcription.failed` events with `transcript_source=deepgram`
- DLQ for `deepgram-transcription-dlq` accumulating

### Investigation Steps

1. **Check Deepgram status:** https://status.deepgram.com

2. **Examine error details:**
   ```
   CloudWatch Insights on /aws/lambda/media-summarizer-deepgram-transcription:
   fields @timestamp, job_id, error_type, error_code, duration_ms
   | filter event = "worker.transcription.failed" AND transcript_source = "deepgram"
   | sort @timestamp desc
   | limit 20
   ```

3. **Common error types:**
   - `DeepgramAPIError`: API returning errors (rate limits, auth)
   - `TimeoutError`: Audio files too large or network issues
   - `AudioFormatError`: Unsupported audio format

4. **Check quota:**
   - Verify Deepgram API key quota and usage
   - Check if concurrent request limit is reached

### First Response

- If Deepgram outage: wait for recovery, messages will retry
- If rate limit: reduce Lambda reserved concurrency for deepgram-transcription
- If audio format: check upstream resolver output
- If API key issue: rotate key in Secrets Manager

### Escalation

- Deepgram outage > 1h: contact Deepgram support
- API key quota exhausted: upgrade plan or contact support

---

## LlamaParse Fallback

**Alarm:** `media-summarizer-llamaparse-fallback-rate-breach`
**Severity:** Medium
**Threshold:** Unstructured fallback triggered > N times/hour (configurable, default 20)

### Symptoms

- `document_parsing.primary_failed` events increasing
- `document_parsing.fallback_success` events compensating
- Documents still being parsed but via the fallback path (Unstructured API)

### Investigation Steps

1. **Check LlamaParse quota:**
   - Free tier: 1000 pages/day
   - Check daily usage at https://cloud.llamaindex.ai

2. **Examine failure reasons:**
   ```
   CloudWatch Insights on /aws/lambda/media-summarizer-document-parsing:
   fields @timestamp, job_id, error_code, provider
   | filter event = "document_parsing.primary_failed"
   | stats count(*) by error_code
   ```

3. **Common causes:**
   - `RATE_LIMITED`: Daily quota exhausted
   - `TIMEOUT`: LlamaParse taking too long (large documents)
   - `AUTH_ERROR`: API key invalid or expired

### First Response

- If quota exhausted: the fallback (Unstructured) is handling it -- no immediate action needed, but monitor Unstructured costs
- If auth error: check/rotate LLAMAPARSE_API_KEY in Secrets Manager
- If timeout: consider splitting large documents before parsing

### Escalation

- If both LlamaParse AND Unstructured are failing: `document_parsing.all_failed` will fire Lambda error rate alarm
- If cost concern: evaluate upgrading LlamaParse plan vs relying on Unstructured

---

## LLM Generation Failures

**Alarms:** `media-summarizer-llm-provider-refused-<env>`, `media-summarizer-llm-generation-failures-<env>`
**Severity:** Critical (provider refused) / High (any other cause)
**Thresholds:** provider refusal = any occurrence in 5 minutes; other causes = more than 3 in 15 minutes
**Defined in:** `infrastructure/terraform/modules/platform/llm_alerts.tf`

The two workers that call the LLM — `artifact_generator` and
`transcript_translation` — hide their failures from `AWS/Lambda` `Errors` (see
[Lambda Errors](#lambda-errors)). These two alarms are the only automated signal
that artifact generation has stopped working. They exist because on 2026-09-01
the OpenAI credit ran out, the backend produced no artifact for an entire
session, and nothing could fire.

### Metric

| | |
|---|---|
| Namespace | `MediaSummarizer/Pipeline/<env>` |
| Metric name | `LlmGenerationFailures` |
| Dimension | `FailureKind` — `provider_refused` \| `other` |
| Statistic | `Sum` |
| Source log event | `llm.generation_failed` (level ERROR) |
| Source log groups | `/aws/lambda/media-summarizer-worker-artifact_generator-<env>`, `/aws/lambda/media-summarizer-worker-transcript_translation-<env>` |
| Metric filters | `llm-generation-failed-artifact-generator-<env>`, `llm-generation-failed-transcript-translation-<env>` |

Like every other metric in this module, it is derived from a log metric filter —
the application never calls `put_metric_data`. The event contract lives in
`media_summarizer/utils/llm_failure.py`; the `failure_kind` values there and the
dimension values here must stay identical.

Fields carried by the event: `worker`, `provider`, `failure_kind`,
`refusal_reason` (`quota` \| `authentication` \| `rate_limit`, only when
`failure_kind = provider_refused`), `provider_status`, `error_type`, `detail`,
plus `artifact_id` / `artifact_type` or `transcript_s3_key` / `target_language`
depending on the worker.

### Symptoms

- Artifacts stay `queued`/`failed` and no content appears in the app
- Transcripts come back untranslated with the failure badge
- `Errors` at 0 and empty DLQs on both worker Lambdas — the failures never raise

### Investigation Steps

1. **Read the failures and their class:**
   ```
   CloudWatch Insights on /aws/lambda/media-summarizer-worker-artifact_generator-<env>
   and /aws/lambda/media-summarizer-worker-transcript_translation-<env>:

   fields @timestamp, worker, failure_kind, refusal_reason, provider_status, error_type, detail
   | filter event = "llm.generation_failed"
   | sort @timestamp desc
   | limit 50
   ```

2. **If `failure_kind = provider_refused`, read `refusal_reason`:**
   - `quota` — the OpenAI account has no credit left (HTTP 402, a 429 naming
     money — `insufficient_quota`, `credit_balance_exhausted`, any `billing`
     wording — or a bare 429 with no marker and no `Retry-After`, which is read as
     a billing wall on purpose). Check the balance at
     https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview
   - `authentication` — the key is missing, revoked or wrong (HTTP 401/403, or
     `openai_api_key_missing`). `OPENAI_API_KEY` lives in the runtime secret;
     see task-252 for who holds the values.
   - `rate_limit` — throttling the provider named itself (429 with
     `rate_limit_exceeded`, a "requests per min" message or a `Retry-After`
     header). The only refusal that is transient, so it is also the only one whose
     SQS messages are retried.

3. **If `failure_kind = other`, group by cause:**
   ```
   fields error_type, detail
   | filter event = "llm.generation_failed" and failure_kind = "other"
   | stats count(*) by error_type
   ```
   Usual suspects: a validation error on the model output
   (`*ValidationError`, also visible as `error_code = VALIDATION_ERROR`),
   `corpus_too_large` on a folder above `MAX_FOLDER_CORPUS_TOKENS`, or an
   S3 read failure on a transcript.

### First Response

- `quota`: top the account up. Nothing else recovers the pipeline. Do not look
  for the failed generations in the DLQ: a permanent refusal is acknowledged on
  its first delivery (task-333) rather than hammered twice more, so the artifact
  entries are `failed` in DynamoDB and the way back is to ask for them again from
  the app once credit is restored.
- `authentication`: fix the key in the runtime secret. Same as `quota`: the
  refusal is permanent, so nothing is waiting in SQS — the generations have to be
  requested again after the Lambda cold-starts on the new secret.
- `rate_limit`: no action; if it persists, lower the reserved concurrency of
  `artifact_generator` so fewer generations compete for the same rate window.
- `other`: fix the underlying cause, then replay the DLQ.

### Escalation

- Provider refusals still firing 30 min after the account was topped up: check
  whether the deployed Lambda picked up the new secret (cold start required).
- Recurrent `VALIDATION_ERROR` on one artifact type: it is a prompt/schema
  regression, not an incident — open a task against that generator.

---

## Bug Reports

**Alarm:** `media-summarizer-bug-report-created`
**Severity:** Critical
**Threshold:** Any report submitted (>0) in 5 minutes

### Overview

Users submit bug reports from the app's Report a Bug screen, either about a
specific media item (with `media_item_id` and `error_code`) or about the app
itself (from the Account tab). The alarm fires once per report: one report, one
mail. There is no background level of bug reports acceptable to ignore.

The structured log event carries:
- `report_id`: unique ticket identifier
- `user_id`: who filed it
- `source_platform`: ios or android
- `source_app_version`: app version string
- `media_item_id`: media the report is about (only if filed from failure screen)
- `error_code`: the error code the user saw (only if filed from failure screen)

### Symptoms

- Email arrives with "A new bug report was submitted"
- Check the CloudWatch log event for the structured fields above

### Investigation Steps

1. **Read the report in DynamoDB:**
   ```bash
   aws dynamodb get-item --region eu-west-3 \
     --table-name bug_reports-dev \
     --key '{"id": {"S": "<report_id>"}}'
   ```

2. **If the report names a media item:**
   - Read its library row to understand what the user was processing
   - Check `processing_jobs` for any pending or failed jobs on that media

3. **If this is a recurring issue on the same `error_code`:**
   - It may indicate a worker failure or platform degradation
   - Cross-reference the code against the relevant worker's alarm

### First Response

- Acknowledge receipt: reply to the SNS email or check the item in the console
- Determine triage priority and create a backlog task if needed
- If urgent (app crash, data loss): escalate immediately

### Escalation

- Crash bugs: P0, investigate immediately
- Data loss: P0, treat as incident
- High-volume reports on one `error_code`: may indicate a systemic failure
- If >10 reports in 1 hour: likely a regression, consider rollback

---

## Archiver Failure

**Alarms:** `media-summarizer-job-archiver-silent-failure` (composite), `media-summarizer-job-archiver-archive-gap`
**Severity:** Critical
**Threshold:** silent-failure = archiver Lambda invoked while zero objects archived in the same 5-minute period; archive-gap = `remove_records - archived > 0`

Both alarms answer the same question in two different ways, because the failure
they exist for (task-218 §1.5) was an archiver invoked 144 times that never wrote
an object while `processing_jobs` rows were expiring:

- `archive-gap` sees the handler run and drop deletions. Derived from the
  `job_archiver.batch_completed` JSON summary line emitted once per invocation.
- `silent-failure` is the composite of `job-archiver-invoked` (`AWS/Lambda`
  `Invocations`, emitted by the platform, not by the function) AND
  `job-archiver-nothing-archived` (`treat_missing_data = breaching`, so a handler
  that logs nothing at all still breaches). This is the one that survives a
  regression to a no-op deployment package.

### Symptoms

- The archives bucket stops growing while jobs keep disappearing from `processing_jobs`
- `job_archiver.batch_completed` shows `archived` below `remove_records`, or is absent entirely

### Investigation Steps

1. **Read the invocation summaries:**
   ```
   CloudWatch Insights on /aws/lambda/media-summarizer-job-archiver-<env>:
   fields @timestamp, remove_records, archived, failed
   | filter event = "job_archiver.batch_completed"
   | sort @timestamp desc
   ```
   No rows at all + non-zero `Invocations` = the deployed package is not the real
   archiver. Check `CodeSize` on the function against a local build of
   `media_summarizer/workers/cleanup/job_archiver.py`.

2. **Check what actually landed:**
   ```
   aws s3 ls s3://media-summarizer-archives-<account>-<env>/$(date -u +%Y/%m/%d)/
   ```

3. **Common causes:**
   - `ARCHIVE_BUCKET` unset on the function (the handler reports the whole batch as `failed`)
   - `s3:PutObject` denied on the archives bucket
   - Records without `OldImage` (stream view type changed away from `OLD_IMAGE`/`NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES`)

### First Response

- The deletions already lost cannot be recovered from the stream (24h retention at best).
  If the TTL is the source of the deletions, consider raising
  `processing_jobs_ttl_days` while the archiver is broken to slow the bleeding.
- Fix the archiver, then confirm recovery: a successful invocation writes
  `archived >= 1`, which returns both alarms to OK.

### Escalation

- If rows are expiring unarchived for more than one TTL window, treat as data loss
  and reopen the task-218 durable-persistence thread.

## From a Sentry Issue

**Tool:** `scripts/sentry_issue.py`

Mobile app crashes and freezes are reported to Sentry, not to CloudWatch. The app
deliberately never calls `Sentry.setUser` (per `docs/compliance/apple-app-privacy.md`,
to keep the "Crash Data — Not linked to identity" declaration true), so a Sentry
issue carries no `user_id` and no account information. The only join key to the
backend is the **`mediaItemId`** recorded in the `save.created` breadcrumb when
a share is submitted.

### Investigation Path

1. **Read the issue and its latest event:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/sentry_issue.py --issue-id SECOND-BRAIN-APP-XY
   ```
   The script displays tags (`release`, `dist`, `ota.update_id`, `ota.embedded_launch`,
   `api.host`, `environment`) that attribute the crash to an exact bundle, and all
   breadcrumbs with pipeline categories highlighted (`share.*`, `save.*`,
   `processing.*`, `translation.*`).

2. **Extract the `mediaItemId` from the `save.created` breadcrumb:**
   The script automatically extracts this value and generates a ready-to-copy
   CloudWatch Insights query:
   ```
   filter job_id = "<mediaItemId>"
   ```
   Since `media_item_id == job_id` in the current model, this query traces the
   backend processing for the media item that crashed the app.

3. **Run the query on backend log groups** to see the job's lifecycle, any errors
   during artifact generation, and the final outcome.

### What Sentry Cannot Provide

- **No identity:** the app never calls `Sentry.setUser`, so no crash can be tied
  back to a user account. This is deliberate and documented in the App Privacy
  declaration.
- **No query strings:** HTTP breadcrumbs have their query strings removed by
  `scrubBreadcrumb` (`mobile/src/lib/crashReporting.ts:143-149`) to avoid logging
  search terms (`?q=`) and presigned upload signatures.
