# GitHub Actions deploy identity for the PROD account (task-221 §7.2 points 3-4,
# task-248 volet 3).
#
# It lives in this root rather than in a bootstrap script because, unlike the
# state bucket, nothing about it is a chicken-and-egg problem: prod's state
# already exists by the time this is applied, so the role can be reviewed as
# code. dev's equivalent (media-summarizer-gha-deploy in 125313707865) was
# created by hand out-of-band and stayed unmanaged until task-256, which imported
# it into env/dev/terraform.tfstate — see envs/dev/gha_oidc.tf for the adoption
# runbook and for the three places where dev deliberately diverges from the shape
# below. Adding a permission to one role and not the other is now a visible diff
# rather than a red CI run three weeks later.
#
# The isolation claim, in two independent layers:
#
#   1. Account boundary. This role only exists in 866874944541 and every ARN in
#      its policy is an 866874944541 ARN. It is structurally incapable of naming
#      a dev resource. Symmetrically, media-summarizer-gha-deploy in the dev
#      account grants lambda:UpdateFunctionCode on
#      arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-3:125313707865:function:media-summarizer-* — an ARN
#      that cannot match anything in prod.
#   2. OIDC subject. The trust policy pins `sub` to
#      repo:<owner>/<repo>:environment:production, which GitHub only mints for a
#      job that declares `environment: production`. A workflow job without that
#      declaration cannot assume this role even with the ARN in hand, and the
#      GitHub environment carries the owner's required-reviewer gate.
