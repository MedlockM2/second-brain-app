# GitHub Actions deploy identity for the DEV/management account (task-256).
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and what its absence cost
#
# The role and the OIDC provider below were created by hand on 2026-06-12 and
# lived outside every Terraform state until task-256. The consequence was not
# theoretical: when task-248 gave the prod role a `tag:GetResources` grant —
# because deploy-lambda.yml discovers its targets by `Environment` tag rather
# than by name prefix — there was no dev code to change, so dev never got it.
# Every `deploy-workers` run from 2026-08-10 onwards died on
# `AccessDeniedException ... not authorized to perform: tag:GetResources`, while
# `deploy-api` kept going green because it names its single function directly and
# needs no discovery call at all. A half-green pipeline that deploys the API and
# silently deploys zero workers is the exact failure mode an unmanaged role
# produces: the divergence was only visible in a red run, never in a diff.
#
# ADOPTED, NOT RECREATED. The three resources here were brought in with
# `terraform import` (see the runbook comment at the bottom of this file), so the
# first plan after this file landed was in-place updates only. Recreating them
# instead would have deleted the trust relationship every deploy depends on and
# invalidated the ARN stored in the AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN GitHub secret.
#
# WHERE DEV DIVERGES FROM PROD, deliberately. envs/prod/gha_oidc.tf is the
# reference shape; the differences below are real and each one is load-bearing:
#
#   1. Physical names carry no "-dev" token (`media-summarizer-gha-deploy`, inline
#      policy `deploy`). Both are ForceNew attributes, so aligning them with
#      prod's `-prod`-suffixed names would mean destroying and recreating the very
#      resources this task exists to preserve. The names are the ones AWS has had
#      since 2026-06-12 and they stay.
#   2. The trust policy pins `sub` to repo:<owner>/<repo>:ref:refs/heads/main with
#      StringLike, not to an `environment:` subject with StringEquals. dev is
#      deployed automatically by a push to main, by jobs that declare no GitHub
#      environment — that is the whole point of the split, and it is what makes
#      the prod role unassumable from those same jobs. Moving dev behind a GitHub
#      environment would be a workflow change, not an IAM one.
#   3. dev may PUSH to the shared ECR repository; prod may only pull. Images are
#      built once here and promoted to prod by digest (task-221 §7.1), so a prod
#      job that could push would be able to mint an artifact that never went
#      through dev.
#
# Isolation, for the record: every ARN in the policy below is a 125313707865 ARN,
# so this role is structurally incapable of naming a prod resource — the account
# boundary from task-248 does that half of the job on its own. Within the account
# the Lambda grant is suffixed `-dev`, which matters because envs/staging/main.tf
# is a live blueprint that lands in THIS account: a bare `media-summarizer-*` (what
# the hand-made policy carried) would have let a push to main overwrite a staging
# function's code the day someone applies that root.
