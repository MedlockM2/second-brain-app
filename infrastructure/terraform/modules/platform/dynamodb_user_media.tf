# user_media -- the durable library record (task-240, Phase 1)
#
# Owner-validated Option A of
# docs/research/task-218-durable-media-library-persistence/README.md, §4.1.
#
# This table is the single source of truth for "what is in my library".
# `processing_jobs` is demoted to purely operational state that is free to
# expire, which is only safe because nothing user-facing depends on it any more.
#
# Two properties are load-bearing and must not be edited casually:
#
#   1. `purge_at` is the ONLY TTL attribute, and only a user-initiated deletion
#      may ever write it (invariant I2). No processing-driven TTL exists here.
#      The whole incident documented in §1.2 was a retention clock owned by the
#      pipeline being applied to user-owned data.
#   2. PITR is enabled from day one. `processing_jobs` and `user_folders` were
#      created without it, which is why the rows already lost are unrecoverable
#      (§1.5).

  # A GSI and not an LSI, deliberately: an LSI can only be created *with* the
  # table (see the comment above), and this table carries prevent_destroy,
  # deletion protection and PITR. A GSI is an online UpdateTable -- the table stays
  # available while the backfill runs, and the index is simply not queryable until
  # it reports ACTIVE. That is why the row is empty on the first deploy.
  #
  # INCLUDE and not ALL: the projected attributes are exactly what a tile draws, so
  # the read path is render-ready with no fetch back to the table. `deleted_at` is
  # projected so the read can drop a row the user soft-deleted before its purge_at
  # TTL sweeps it -- the signal disappears with its subject, which is the whole
  # reason task-303 stores it here instead of in an activity table.
  # user_id / media_item_id come for free: DynamoDB always projects the base keys.
  #
  # `title_label_key` and `saved_at` travel with the title because a media nothing
  # named has no title at all since task-400: the tile is drawn from the label key
  # and the save date, so leaving either out of the projection would make a
  # "Continue learning" tile the one surface that has to read the row back.
