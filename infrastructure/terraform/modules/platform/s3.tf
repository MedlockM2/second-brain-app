# the clear or under SSE-S3, false under SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS, where the ETag
# becomes an opaque digest of the ciphertext. Switching either bucket to a KMS key
# is therefore a decision about content identity, not a storage detail: the
# ingestion endpoint then answers 422 `upload_fingerprint_encrypted` for every
